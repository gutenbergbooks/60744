<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It is the object of this book to supply the means of forming
an accurate idea of the American government. The author
has adopted the proposition that the highest style of government
is one “<i>of</i> the people, <i>by</i> the people, and <i>for</i> the people,”
and believes that a constant progress, commencing in the earliest
times, has reached its full development in the Great Republic.
He therefore traces <span class="smcap">The Footprints of Time</span> through
all history; notes the gradual unfolding of institutions, the
rise and fall of empires, the causes that produced and destroyed
the ancient republics, and the origin of the forces that
give so much more strength and stability to modern civilization.
All this he considers essential to a correct appreciation
of the wonderful events of our age and country.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to a close and clear analysis of the whole
structure of the government. Each general division, with its
sub-divisions, is examined in detail, but successively; so that a
definite picture of it, with all its branches, operations, and relations
to other parts, stands before the mind as a sharply
defined whole. The Executive, Legislative, and Judicial divisions—the
dependent parts of each kept in proper place—come
in order, one after the other, before the mind, the structure,
powers and working of each being fully explained.</p>

<p>The book is indeed a compilation, and the matter in large
part from official sources, but collected from an astonishingly
large number of books, all of which are not to be found even
in the largest public libraries; but the labor and merit of gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
so much from all directions and compressing a library
into a form and compass so convenient, and so well arranged,
in so few and well chosen words, has been great indeed.</p>

<p>All the works heretofore brought before the public proposing
to meet this want have been fragmentary, or have treated at
too great length but a portion of the subject. A complete
summary, or Citizens’ Manual, is here furnished, that includes
a sufficiently detailed Analysis of the entire structure of the
government, developing in a clear and comprehensive manner
the organization, powers, relations, and mode of working of
each department, small or large, the principles on which they
rest and the spirit that permeates them all. It lays our history
so far under contribution as to show us the occasion that
produced each institution, the gradual growth of the grand
edifice and the causes that controlled and shaped the whole.
In short, it gives us an adequate reason for the form of our
institutions, even so far back as the earlier history of humanity,
when the tendencies that have borne this fruit first began to
appear in human history.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>It is our happiness to live in an age whose master-pieces of
accomplishment, in science, industry and commerce, put to
shame the extravagant fictions of Oriental tales and the wonders
ascribed to the gods and heroes of ancient mythology.
The changes produced by recent investigations and discoveries
are so vast and so rapid that it is difficult to follow them
or comprehend the power and thoroughness of the transformations
that are taking place in the world around us. The applications
of steam and electricity astonish us by their wide
spread influence on the condition and relations of men; the
ease and speed of movement and intercourse, constantly increasing,
are ever putting us in new and unfamiliar situations.
We have hardly accustomed our thoughts and habits to one
before we are hurried on into another. The constantly clearer
and more abundant light shed by science and the press does
not suffice to keep our minds fully up to the progress that goes
on in all departments of life.</p>

<p>It is plain that we have entered on a New Era, the most
extraordinary and momentous the world has ever seen. The
old and imperfect is being cleared away and everything thoroughly
reconstructed. The explanation is that we are now
setting up the grand Temple of Civilization, the separate
stones and pillars of which each nation and age was commissioned
to hew and carve, and, so to speak, left in the quarry
to await the time when, all the material being ready, the Master
Builder should collect all the scattered parts and raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
whole edifice at once, to the astonishment and joy of mankind.</p>

<p>All the institutions and civilizations of the past may be
considered temporary, erected in haste from the materials nearest
at hand, not for permanence, but to serve the present turn
while the special task of the nation or age was being performed.
The races and ages nearer the birth of mankind worked on
rougher parts of the edifice, that entered into the foundations;
those grand races, the Greek and the Roman, furnished the
noble outline which the nations of modern Europe perfected
while they supplied what was still lacking for use and adornment.</p>

<p>America was reserved, designedly, for so many ages, to
furnish a suitable and unencumbered location for the central
halls and mightiest pillars of the completed structure. Our
fathers cleared the ground and laid the foundation deep down
on the living rock, that is to say, on Human Rights. That
they seldom failed to place stone, pillar and column in just
position the work, as we find it, proves, and we have little to
do but to clear away the rubbish, beautify the grounds, and
put the whole to its proper use.</p>

<p>We begin to see that Time, Thought and Experience have
not wrought in vain, that Progress is not a phantom of the
imagination, that the human race is essentially a Unit, that it
has been growing through all the centuries and is now approaching
the prime of its manhood, just ready to enter on its
special career with its grandest work still to do. The energies
of all the races are preparing for unheard of achievements.
The world was never so completely and so wisely busy as now,
and America stands between modern Europe and ancient Asia,
receiving from, and giving to, both. Her institutions are
founded on principles so just and so humane that, when administered
with due wisdom and skill, they will embarrass and
restrain the proper activities of men at <i>no point</i>. America
stands a <i>model</i> which other nations will carefully copy, in due
time, as they can adapt themselves and change their institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
It may not be a <i>literal</i> copy, a servile imitation; but
there is little doubt that our Declaration of Independence
will finally enter, in spirit and potential influence, into the
intimate structure of all governments.</p>

<p>It is the Course of Human Progress, and the important elements
that were successively added as each leading phase of
civilization appeared, that is endeavored to be traced in the
Historical Review of the First Part of this book. While following
the general march of events chronologically, we have
stopped here and there to take a general survey, in order the
better to understand the significance of detached facts, or to
examine a new influence that enters among the forces moulding
the future. Our space did not allow an exhaustive process;
nor was it desirable. We have taken note of only the
more important landmarks of Progress. Too much detail
would confuse the mind by engaging it in an intricate mass
of facts. It is the <i>thread</i> of events, that joins the nations and
ages together, or the <i>channel</i> by which they sent down to our
day—from Asia to Europe, and from Europe to America—each
their special contribution to the political wisdom and the
free institutions of America, that we have endeavored to find.</p>

<p>We hope we have not underrated any people or any time,
and that we have not <i>overrated</i> the value and glory of America.
America is yet young. Its founders, the authors of its Constitution,
were unaware of the singular excellence and nobility
of their work. Like all other people, they built according to
their genius and instincts. Time only could show whether
they built for immortality. They feared and trembled over
their work; but Time has set on it his seal of approval. Our
people are busy using their liberties and energies, each for his
individual benefit, as is quite right and proper; since the welfare
of individuals makes the prosperity of the community.
But a government left to take care of itself is prone to do that
work only too well. We have done well and wisely in important
crises; but a more intelligent and constant watchfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
over the ordinary course of public affairs would have been
still better.</p>

<p>It is plain that the general mind among us has grown clearer
and more accurate in its judgments as experience has accumulated,
for the original direction toward popular freedom has
not changed. Various incongruities have been laid aside and
oversights corrected, the severe strain of civil war and an unheard
of rapidity of growth have not shaken, but more clearly
revealed the strength and unity of the nation. Yet, more intelligence
and more care would have saved us many shocks
and made our success more pronounced and more brilliant.
“Knowledge is power,” when wisely applied; and a more
accurate acquaintance with their government and its history
will enable American Citizens to mould it more wisely still,
to correct all defects of administration, and to speedily reach
that minimum of governmental interference with the efforts
and interests of the citizens which shall give them the fullest
liberty consistent with security and surrender the whole round
of human life, as completely as possible, to the beneficent
action of natural law.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DAWN OF HISTORY.</span></h4>

<p>1. The early traditions of every nation that has undertaken
to relate the story of its origin, have given us a confused
account of supernatural persons and events which the judgment
of more enlightened times has almost uniformly considered
fabulous and impossible. It has always been an
interesting inquiry how much of fact was veiled under this
mythical dress, and a great variety of ingenious and contradictory
explanations have been produced by the learned in all
ages. In most cases, as in Greece, the national religion has
been based on these legends which form its authority and
explanation, and they passed with the people of all early times
as facts which it was impious to question. So the wise
and good Socrates was supposed to have denied the existence
of the national gods, and was condemned to death. This
sacred guard placed over early traditions, increased at once
the interest and the difficulty involved in their examination.</p>

<p>2. During the present century the improved methods,
larger range and more exact style of inquiry, and the assistance
and hints which one branch of study has given to others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have produced the most surprising and satisfactory results.
These inquiries are not yet complete; they seem, on the contrary,
to have only commenced, and promise, ultimately, to
satisfy all the useful purposes and legitimate curiosity of
mankind; still, their conclusions, so far as they go, are unimpeachable.
They prove themselves.</p>

<p>The study of Ethnology, which gives an account of the races
of mankind; a critical comparison of all languages, ancient
and modern; the patient study and ingenious deciphering of
architecture and inscriptions found in ancient ruins, and various
relics of human activity imbedded in the soil of different
countries, have thrown down the barriers which the glowing
imaginations of the poets and the want of authentic documents
in early times had raised, and have given us a clue to
many of the secrets of history, and a safe guide through some
of the dark passages of man’s primitive life.</p>

<p>To show how this is done would require a treatise on Ethnology,
another on Comparative Philology, a third on Antiquarian
Research, and a fourth on the Geological Antiquities
of Man. Each of these brings a large and valuable contribution
to early history. We give only a brief summary of their
conclusions.</p>

<p>3. The human race appears to have had its birth on the
high table lands of central Asia, south and east of the Caspian
Sea. The structure and growth of language, and the remains
of early art, indicate an extremely infantile mental condition
and successive emigrations from the primitive home of the
race. Families and tribes which had remained together long
enough to build up a common language and strong general
features of character and habit, at length separated and
formed a number of families of allied races.</p>

<p>4. The first emigrations were made by the Turanian
nations, which scattered very widely. Turanian means “outside,”
or “barbarian,” and was given by the later and better
known races who found them, commonly in a very wild,
undeveloped state, wherever they themselves wandered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
after times. There are reasons for believing that the first
Turanian migration was to <i>China</i>; that they were never
afterward much interfered with, and that they early reached a
high stage of civilization. It has certainly many very crude
and primitive features. Having worked out all the progressive
impulses dwelling in the primitive stock of their family
almost before other races were heard of, and being undisturbed,
their institutions stiffened and crystalized and made
few improvements for thousands of years. Chinese history
presents a curious problem not yet fully investigated.</p>

<p>Another stream of Turanian emigration is believed to have
settled the more north-easterly portions of Asia. Some time
after the tide set down through Farther India, and to the
islands of Malaysia. In still later periods Hindoostan was
peopled by Turanian races; the ancestors of the Mongols and
Turks were spread over the vast plains of northern and
central Asia; and somewhat later still an irruption into
Europe furnished its primeval people. The Finns and Lapps
in the north, and the Basques of Spain, are the living representatives
of the ancient Turanian stock, while the Magyars,
or Hungarians, are a modern branch of the same race, which
made an irruption into Europe from Asia in the ninth century
of the Christian era. The first appearance of this race in
written history was in the establishment of a powerful empire
at Babylon, which must have been cotemporary with the
earliest Egyptian monarchy, and seems, from the inscriptions
on the most ancient ruins, to have been conquered by, and
mingled with, an Egyptian or Hamite family. It came to an
end before the Assyrian Empire appeared, but seems to have
reached a very considerable degree of development.</p>

<p>5. The other two great families of related languages, and
therefore of common stock or race, are the Semitic and the
Aryan. But previous to the appearance of either of these on
this buried stage of history is a family, apparently related,
distantly, to the Semites, but who might have separated from
the common stock of both before them, called Hamites, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
founded the very ancient and mysterious Egyptian monarchy.
A section of this race conquered the Turanians of Babylon,
and established the largest dominion then known to men.
The Chedor-Laomer of Abraham’s day was one of its mightiest
sovereigns, and ruled over a thickly-settled region a thousand
miles in length by five hundred in breadth. Faint traces of
it are found in profane history, and the Bible narrative is
sustained and largely amplified by inscriptions on ancient
ruins. A second Hamite empire in Babylon is believed to
have followed this, continuing four hundred years, carrying
agriculture and the peaceful arts to a high state of development.</p>

<p>6. Egypt was peopled by the Hamitic race, who founded
two kingdoms, afterwards united. Here, social, political, and
industrial institutions developed very early in great strength.
Their language, the pictorial representation of their social,
political, and religious affairs, and the grand and gloomy majesty
of their works of art, imply a long period of growth
before they reached the maturity in which we find them when
written history commences. Their institutions, even in the
earliest historic times, showed signs of the decrepitude and
decay of age. The vastness and the grim maturity of their
monuments and language seem to lend much support to their
claim of an immense antiquity. The future study of their
remains of art and literature will settle some important problems
in the chronology of the human race. The children of
Ham were clearly the first to lead off in the march of civilization.</p>

<p>The Semitic family, deriving its name from Shem, or Sem,
the eldest son of Noah, is not as large nor as widely spread as
the Turanian and Aryan, but has exerted an even greater influence
on human destiny. It never strayed much from Asia,
except to people small portions of Africa. They early appear
in Western Asia as the successors of the second Hamitic
empire in Babylon and Assyria. Settled in Phenicia, on the
eastern shore of the Mediterranean sea, they became the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
maritime and commercial people, and, with their colony established
in Carthage, in the north of Africa, exerted a powerful
influence in promoting the civilization of the ancient world.
The Semites early peopled the Arabian peninsula, and established
a state in Ethiopia, as some believe, before Egypt had
attained its full development. The Ethiopians established a
flourishing commerce on the Red Sea, with the eastern coasts of
Africa, and with India, and contributed greatly to the resources
of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>They have always been a religious race, and gave the three
great religions, Judaism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity, to
the world, as well as some of the most debasing superstitions and
forms of idolatry ever known. The larger part of the population
of Asia is still Turanian, and the Semites now occupy
about the same area as in prehistoric times; but the Hamites
have been overpowered and have lost their clearly distinctive
character as a family, unless represented by the negro tribes.</p>

<p>7. The third great family, the Aryan, called also the Japhetic,
from Japhet, the third son of Noah, and from the
regions they peopled and made illustrious by their genius and
activity, the Indo-European, was the last to leave the birthplace
of mankind. The other races were incapable of carrying
the fortunes of humanity beyond a certain point, of themselves
alone, as the history of Turanian China, Hamitic Egypt
and the Semitic Mohammedans and Jews clearly proves.
The history of the Aryans shows them to possess inexhaustible
mental power and physical stamina, with a vigorous ambition,
always dissatisfied with the present, and constantly
seeking something better in the future and the distant, that
have produced the happiest effect on the destinies of the
human race.</p>

<p>8. It would seem that while the Turanians, Hamites, and
Semites were taking the lead of the world and building up the
empires of prehistoric times, whose mighty ruins have been
the wonder of later ages, the Aryans were all united in following
peaceful pursuits, which the common features of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
languages indicate were chiefly the care of flocks and herds.
They were much farther removed from barbarism than any of
the other races when they began their wanderings. Warlike,
agricultural and nautical terms, and the names of wild animals
are not often found in the common vocabulary; while family
relations, domestic animals and their uses, the heavenly bodies
in connection with worship and the priestly relation of the
father of the family, and terms indicating a considerable cultivation
of sensibility and thoughtfulness, imply a purer social
and religious condition, and more elevated mental traits, than
in the primitive forefathers of the other families. Their
language was highly picturesque, and its peculiar terms for
natural phenomena are believed by some to have originated
the mythological histories of the ancient Greeks and Romans
and Teutonic nations. The ancient language used epithets
and names, so glowing with personality, that the imaginative
descendants of the primitive stock, when their early history
was forgotten, believed them to contain an account of the
origin of things, and the early deeds of gods and heroes; and
the genius of the poets clothed the supposed marvels in the
immortal dress of fiction which we find in Homer and Hesiod,
in Virgil, the Indian Vedas, and the Sagas and Scalds of northern
Europe. This, at least, is the conclusion reached by some
of the most eminent scholars and philologists, whose study of
the formation and growth of languages has thrown so much
light on the ante-historical periods. These myths, the germs
of which were embodied in their language, embellished by the
supposed inspired genius of the poets, formed the literature
and theology of the early historic nations, and were received
as undisputed truth.</p>

<p>9. The first migration of the Aryan family appears to
have occurred through the passes of the Caucasus, northwest
to the northern part of Asia Minor and Southern Europe.
The Turanian nations, or “barbarians,” were everywhere found
in advance of them, in a very degraded condition, and the
native spirit and ambition of the Aryan people rendered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the uniform conquerors. Afterward, another migration southward
peopled India, and, in the earliest historic times, the part
of the family still remaining in the ancient home of the race
established the brilliant empire of the Medes and Persians,
who extended their sway over all the central and western parts
of Asia, broke down the ancient monarchy of Egypt, and, in
the height of their power and glory, swept like a tempest into
Europe with the purpose of subjugating a few self-governing
tribes of their own race dwelling on the shores and among the
mountains of the small peninsula of Greece. The failure of
the mighty empire in this effort, through the indomitable resolution
of a handful of hardy republicans, forms one of the
most glorious pages of history. It was a grand era in the
development of civilization, and Grecian culture became the
inheritance of the world.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DIRECTION OF PRE-HISTORIC GROWTH.</span></h4>

<p>1. The three classes of indications on which we rely for a
knowledge of the advance of mankind previous to the period
when authentic history comes to our aid—the researches of
geologists among the accidental traces of man’s early activities,
the ruins of ancient cities, and the study of the growth of language—unite
in testifying to an extremely rude, feeble and
childish condition of the earliest representatives of the race,
and to a progressive improvement in knowledge and capacity,
precisely like what occurs in the case of every individual of
our kind. A fourth more general observation also confirms
this view. This is the obscurity that covers the early ages.
Aside from the Bible narrative, a cloud rests on the early history
of every people. A long period passes before they begin
to reflect, to look around and back toward their origin, and
still another of groping thought and study before they are
led to record their reflections and experiences. The necessities
and habit of social intercourse give rise to language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gradually mature it; a long period would necessarily pass
before the natural aversion to other than desultory labor, the
increase of population and the habit of obedience to an authority
requiring continued painful toil, would render the massive
monuments of some of the earlier peoples possible, and before
their attempts at architecture could mature and originate the
elaborate ruins which time has not been able to destroy during
so many centuries.</p>

<p>2. One of the most striking traits of pre-historic times is
the simplicity and awkwardness that characterize childhood.
The Chinese language has been remarked upon as showing the
extremely infantile cast of mind among the people who formed
and retained it to our times. Each word is a sentence, standing
by itself originally; the tone and gesture give it much of
its signification. It would seem as if its authors had never
grown to the idea of an elaborated sentence. There is an average
of eight words, spelled and pronounced exactly alike, for
every sound used. There are, it is said, 212 characters pronounced
<i>che</i>; 138 pronounced <i>foo</i>; and 1165 which all read <i>e</i>,
and each letter is a word, a phrase and a sentence, and may be
an adjective, a noun, or a verb, or all three together. The
difficulty of expressing shades of meaning, or all that may be
in the thought, where so much must be acquired before expression
is possible, has kept the Chinese mind, in many respects,
in a state of childhood, though they have preserved a stability
of character and institutions nowhere else observed. The
primitive mind and habits are maintained as if crystalized.
The principle of decay, so universal elsewhere, would seem, by
some singular process, banished from a vast nation, as it is in
the human body in Egyptian mummies. The same feature is
observable in a smaller degree among the Hindoos, and seems
to have characterized the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>3. Such a habit of fixity among the early races, whose
position secured them from disturbance by the more restless
tribes, was favorable to the construction of the stupendous
monuments which have been the wonder of after ages. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
those races have been remarkably exclusive. It was not until
nearly four hundred years after the era of authentic history
that Egypt was freely open to all the Greeks. These observations
apply only to those portions of the human family which
were stranded in some quiet nook outside of the current of
movement that carried along the most of mankind. Change
of place, intercourse, conflict and conquest were the chief
early educators. The isolated nations, after exhausting the
power of their first impulses, ceased to improve. Their minds,
institutions and habits stiffened and petrified. Nor did the
families that wandered far from the general centre of movement
usually acquire any high degree of development. They
were characterized by unsettled habits; not favorable to highly
organized institutions.</p>

<p>4. It was around, and westward of, the common centre of
the race that a course of steady improvement went on. Here
the laws of inheritance and suggestion, the stimulus of constant
friction, and the infusion of newer and more enterprising
blood worked the freest and developed the elements of a true
civilization the soonest. If the legendary history of Greece
is not to be trusted in its details, it at least establishes the
certainty of active movement and incessant conflict out of
which was, at length, evolved a noble, if incomplete, civilization.
The Greeks were near enough to the scene of stirring
action in Western Asia to be benefited by its influence without
having their institutions frequently disturbed and broken
up before they had reached any degree of maturity, as was
the case with the Assyrians, Persians and Phenicians. They
reaped the fruit, without sharing the disasters, of the great
surgings back and forward which we find to have been the
condition of the Asiatic peoples at the time reliable history
begins to observe them. It appears to have been the same in
that region (Western Asia) as far back as monument, legend,
or science can trace. The fruit of this shock of races and
mental activity matured on the spot the greatest and best
religious systems the world has ever known, the three greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of which have survived to our own day, viz.: the Judaic, the
Christian and the Mohammedan. The germs of the other
two were contained in the system of Abraham and Moses.
Thus the three most important influences needed for the progress
of civilization in the true direction were supplied in
pre-historic times—the seething and surging of the nations
in the West of Asia, a high religious ideal, and the primary
discipline of the Greeks.</p>

<p>5. The lantern of science has guided us on the Track of
Time by his advancing Footprints down to the period when
the grand luminary, Written History, begins to shine from
the hills of Greece. Looking over what was then known of
Asia we find it a vast battlefield, on the western border of
which were the Jews, receiving lessons of instruction or chastisement
from the surrounding nations, and slowly evolving
the Master Religion of the world, the massive grandeur of
Egypt is dimly visible in the south, and on the eastern horizon
rise the immense walls and towers of the huge cities of
Nineveh and Babylon. On the north and west all is darkness,
though we subsequently learn that the elements of a
high culture among the Etrurians of Italy were waiting their
destruction at the hands of valiant Rome, yet to be. The
Phenicians were beginning to scour the sea and to build up a
flourishing commerce, and the cities of Greece had already
learned, from the tyranny of their petty kings, the advantages
of free government.</p>

<p>The period of authentic history is held to have commenced
seven hundred and seventy-six years before the Christian era.
In that year the Greeks began to record the name of the conqueror
in the Olympian games—a national and religious festival,
which had been commenced long before—and it was
called the First Olympiad. It formed the first definite starting
point of the true and fairly reliable historians who, some four
hundred years later, began to write a carefully-studied account
of what was known of their own and of other countries. It
was the time when dates of passing events first began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
stated in the records of the cities and kingdoms of Greece,
and marks the beginning of a real civilization and culture,
and the course of events began to be rescued from the magnifying
and marvel-loving imaginations of the people.</p>

<p>6. The seven hundred and fifty years that follow are in the
highest degree interesting and important; for they record the
achievements of the early manhood of humanity, as represented
by the nations that were most advanced in civilization,
or contributed to the general progress of the world. Men
developed their inherent capacities far more during that
period than in all the previous centuries, however numerous
they may have been. It was followed by about five hundred
years of gradual decline, and that by a thousand years of confusion
caused by the corruption of the old society and the
imperfection of its elements, together with the irruption of
vast hordes of barbarians, who brought in fresh and vigorous,
but untamed blood, with rude and fierce manners. They
were gradually tamed by fusion with the cultured races, and
out of this union arose a civilization broader and more just,
toward the perfection of which we ourselves are now rapidly
advancing, and which, by its multiform vigor and unlimited
resources, seems above the reach of decay. Its power of
infusing new life into worn-out peoples and renewing the
youth of nations as well as of civilizing barbarians appears
irresistible.</p>

<p>From this outlook we return to consider the steps by which
Time has led us to such a desirable eminence.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_III">SECTION III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS.</span></h4>

<p>1. Man, at first, had no institutions. He existed in the
simplest and most spontaneous way, finding shelter in caves
and clefts of the rocks and beneath the primeval forests, groping
his way by strong instincts which soon began to dawn into
intelligence of the lowest and most material kind. How long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
he led a purely <i>animal</i> life we have no means of knowing;
but we may suppose that the necessities of self-preservation
and his powerful social instincts very soon developed the
germs of the family and of language.</p>

<p>Childhood is comparatively long, and many generations
must have passed before language could have acquired the
distinctness and fixity that permitted it to come down through
so long a period, and by so many different channels, to us.
Yet there is plain evidence of an Eastern origin of all the various
families of the race, and of a considerable mental development
previous to the wanderings that peopled the East, the
West, and the South. It has been remarked by Geologists
that the introduction of any class of animal life was never
made by its very <i>lowest</i> orders, but usually by a class intermediate
in organization between the highest and the lowest;
some of the very lowest orders being represented in our own
time.</p>

<p>2. A tolerably hardy race, which could endure the exposures
and overcome the difficulties that must be greater for the
first few generations than ever afterward, as we have every
reason to believe, was first introduced. It has been common
to suppose that man must have been supplied with a fund of
knowledge, and a basis of language, to have successfully met
the difficulties of his condition; but the uniform law that the
<i>faculties</i>, the <i>innate capabilities</i> of his race, are conferred
on him, and that he works them out by a process of development
is observable in his entire history, so far as we can trace
it. All needful capacities being lodged in him, with strong
appetites and instincts to impel him to the objects most vitally
necessary to his own preservation and the continuance of his
species, and the material from which to work out his predestined
ends being placed within his reach, it is made his indispensable
duty and his glory to realize those ends, soon or late,
by his own endeavors. The evidences of his early activity,
unearthed here and there by geologists, show him to have
advanced by degrees from the lowest points, and such corroborative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
proof as the earliest forms of language afford are decidedly
in the same direction.</p>

<p>3. Many of the terms employed for the first and most
familiar objects with which the necessities of life brought him
in contact, show the very imperfect extent of his early knowledge
and resources, and they gradually change in a way to
indicate, most significantly, a slow and laborious, but constant
enlargement of ideas by experience. He advanced then, as
now, by degrees. The races latest in development, as well as
most vigorous and intelligent, were the Aryan, or Indo-European.
They have left the most definite traces of their early
condition and advancement in the common elements of their
various languages, which show very clearly how much time
and toil were required to work out the features of their
first Institution—The Family. The proper family type established
relations of protection and dependence, of care and
trust, of purity and tenderness, of provident foresight, and the
shelter and comforts of Home. Apparently it was many centuries
after the other races had begun to migrate that this
last and most valuable stock commenced to be “fruitful and
multiply,” to tame animals for their use, to enclose and render
their habitations comfortable, and to organize and designate
their family relations down to son-in-law and daughter-in-law,
as well as to name the most common domestic animals and
occupations.</p>

<p>4. The fact doubtless existed long before common experience
and common consent had settled on the terms that
have remained the same in the language of the Hindoos, the
Greeks, the Romans, and the Germanic families; but by many
certain signs we know that it was only gradually that the
tenderness and beauty and usefulness of this institution had
laid the sure foundation of a future vigorous and virtuous
civilization. This race devoted themselves mainly to the care
of flocks and herds, though we find among them the knowledge
of wheat and some other grains; they had very little
experience of war until they separated and began their wanderings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
as we infer from the fact that their common terms are
nearly all peaceful—those designating a warlike habit differing
in all the various branches of the stock.</p>

<p>The Family, with them, was usually founded on marriage—the
union of one man and one woman—which laid great
restraints on vice and preserved the growing society from
manifold evils. The other races—Turanian, Hamitic and
Semitic—appear to have been much more careless in this
respect, and admitted a vicious element into the base of
society, which loosened the bonds of relationship and discipline.
They practiced polygamy, which magnified the position
of the father, while it deprived him of the closer and more
intimate relations to his household on which refinement
depends, and degraded the mother who became the simple
minister of pleasure to, and the means of increasing the influence
of, the Patriarchal head. This point is very vividly
shown in the earlier history of the Israelites where the unhappy
effects of polygamy are distinctly portrayed. From the
same source we see how the first institution among men gradually
grew into the Tribe, and the foundations of Organized
Government were laid.</p>

<p>5. Population rapidly increased, the original progenitor, or
the oldest of his male descendants, became the fountain of
authority and influence, and was, in many cases, the chief or
king, exercising an undefined control, sometimes absolute and
despotic, and again that of a merely nominal head, the variations
taking every shade between the two. Occasionally, special
gifts, as energy, foresight and skill, favored by circumstances,
raised one in the tribe to eminence, and he became the acknowledged
ruler to the exclusion of the patriarch, or hereditary heir
of the patriarchal office, as in the case of Joseph in Egypt, and,
in later times, Moses, Joshua and the Judges.</p>

<p>6. Again, a pastoral life being abandoned, the people gathered
for various reasons in towns, and cities were built up,
where the original style of government became impossible,
from the mixed character of the population; the oldest, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
family government, being founded on relationship and traditional
respect. The need of leadership and the service rendered
by some member of the community founded a despotic authority.
In many cases a city was founded by an adventurer who
had gathered supporters around him by some special ability,
or by some accidental pre-eminence, as we see in Nimrod and
Romulus; or, as often occurred, the head of a family or tribe
which forsook the pastoral life and founded a city, from a
patriarch or chieftain became a king.</p>

<p>Government, in early times, was very imperfectly organized.
It gradually advanced with some people to a high point; while
with others it continued in a very undeveloped state for long
periods—some races never having reached any high stage at
all, or only temporarily under some talented individual.</p>

<p>The first settled governments are found in fertile river valleys
where the cultivation of the soil arrested roving and desultory
habits, and often formed the nucleus of an empire. There
is reason to believe that the first emigration from the early
home of the race was toward the east, that a state was soon
formed in China which became considerably civilized and
fairly well organized the earliest of all. Their national traditions
and some of their recorded dates claim a vast antiquity.
It is not yet determined by scholars how much credit is to be
allowed to these claims.</p>

<p>7. As it appears at present, two other governments were
organized at nearly the same time, one in the lower valley of
the Euphrates and the other on the Nile. It is also possible
that a fourth was built up in India nearly cotemporary with
these. Certain similarities between the ancient ruins of Egypt
and India, and the traditions in the latter country have given
rise to the suspicion; but no certainty has yet been reached.
Several systems of chronology, independent of each other, are
found in Egypt, all agreeing as to its enormous antiquity, but
disagreeing in some important points, and satisfactory tests
have not yet been met with, so that the early days of Egypt
are very obscure. The evidences of a clearly defined progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are presented in its monuments, but the earliest bear so strong
a resemblance to the later that there is some reason for supposing
that the first inhabitants had reached a considerable
degree of maturity before settling there. As yet, however,
that point is only an inference—the most probable escape
from a difficulty. The empires established on the Euphrates,
and north of that on the Tigris, mark the steps of progress
very distinctly, and furnish fairly satisfactory means of computing
their general chronology.</p>

<p>8. In all these cases it appears from monuments, traditions,
and from whatever information the records of the Bible and
other histories give us, that when men began to gather in communities,
cultivate the ground and build cities, their governments
were controlled by kings. Despotic sovereignty was the
natural and necessary instrument of government. The vigorous
will of an admired chief concentrated the energies of the
community, and a state was formed. The beginnings were
very rude and improvement was slow, never reaching beyond
the simple application of force as to the structure and modes
of government. But another element, founded on the religious
nature of mankind, which also had entered as an important
influence into family government from the earliest times,
became organized in the early days of monarchy, viz.:</p>

<h4>THE INSTITUTION OF A PRIESTHOOD.</h4>

<p>9. It would appear, from such traces of a religious tendency
as are found in the primary languages, that the religious
instinct was awakened by an observation of the forces of nature,
which struck the mind with wonder, admiration, or terror.
The mysteries of growth, the power of winds and storms and
waters, the calm beauty, beneficence and brilliance of the sun,
moon and stars riding undisturbed in the heavens, impressed
man with a sense of something superior to himself. The
moods of nature suggested some unknown being with a varying
disposition like his own. His wants, his hopes and fears,
and his sense of helplessness soon led him to seek to propitiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
these unknown powers. The first religion, among all the primitive
nations, seems to have been a worship of the powers of
nature. The head of the family was naturally the first priest
of the family. This office increased the respect in which he
was held by his multiplying descendants, and contributed to
strengthen his authority.</p>

<p>10. But when, in the organization of cities and states,
patriarchal influence decayed, and was replaced by the authority
of the chieftain or the king, a class of men was set apart
to fill the office of religious instructors, to discover the art
and conduct the acts of general worship. The great mystery
and uncertainty surrounding the objects of worship, required
exclusive study and a supposed purity and elevation of mind
impossible to others which soon raised the priesthood into an
institution much revered. It acquired great influence, and
afforded an opening to ambition only inferior to that of the
chief or king. The two commonly united for mutual support,
and thus mankind gained two institutions destined to be of
incalculable value, as well as of almost boundless injury. In
the earlier ages they must have been an almost unmixed good.
They disciplined, the one the labors, the other the minds, of
communities. They were the two most powerful instruments
for initiating progress. They moulded the mass, gave it form,
and directed its energies.</p>

<p>To a certain degree they each formed a check on the excessive
tendencies of the other. But, the power of each fairly
established, they often united to set very hurtful limits to
spontaneous action. The king used his power to the common
injury, and the priests their knowledge to the common debasement.
The first exhausted the sources of prosperity and
growth among his people to gratify his caprices and pleasures,
and the priesthood promoted degrading superstitions and a
gross idolatry to strengthen their influence. It was for the
interest of both to keep the people in pupilage, and check all
tendencies to independent action or thought. Had it been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
possible for them to be wise and high-minded, the race would
have been saved many centuries of debasement and misery.</p>

<p>11. These evils were, in some degree, checked by influences
which have ever since been the mainspring of progress—<i>War</i>
and <i>Commerce</i>. In early times, relationships of blood or of
immediate interest were the chief bonds among men. All
outside the family, tribe, or nation were usually held as enemies;
and passion, interest, or ambition in the ruler led to
constant conflict. But the shock of peoples awakened their
minds, made them acquainted with each other, made their
inventions and arts in some degree common property, and
mingled the thought and blood of different races; and this
greatly enlarged the ideas and capacities of both conquerors
and conquered. The acquaintance made in this way, with men
and countries, led to an interchange of products, during quiet
times, and trade and commerce soon sprung up. This, appealing
to the best interests and instincts of the most enterprising
among the people, has always been a powerful instrument of
advancement. It led to distant voyages and travels, to observation
and intercourse, with a view to pecuniary advantage, to
inventions and improvements in industry and art, that kept
the peoples so related in a state of constant progress.</p>

<p>12. A growing population required increasing attention to
agriculture and the mechanic arts, and increasing wealth led
to architectural display and the increase of instruments of
luxury, the production of which disciplined the skill of the
artisan and contributed to the general growth. All these were
the elements and foundation of civilization. An organization
commenced, and a state founded, the king soon found leisure
to look about and envy the wealth and territories of his neighbor.
He made war and commenced a career of conquest, or
fell, under defeat, into his neighbor’s hand, when time took a
step forward, and a new consolidation, wider and higher than
the former, was laid on a broader base. Slowly but surely an
advance was made.</p>

<p>13. We are now to observe this gradual development in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the successive history of five monarchies in Asia and the kingdom
of Egypt, down to the time when they all fell before the
conquering power of Greece, under Alexander the Great,
which introduces new and far higher elements of progress
among the civilized races, and forms the full opening of a new
Era.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_IV">SECTION IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">ANCIENT MONARCHIES.</span></h4>

<p>1. The Chaldean Monarchy was the first in order of time.
It seems very likely that the first settlement which, in the slow
development of the earliest races, finally produced an organized
kingdom on the lower part of the Euphrates, was made
somewhere in the neighborhood of 3000 years before the
Christian Era. It is, however, a matter of dispute between
the best authorities whether it can be placed so far back. The
monuments of that age are difficult to decipher, but it seems
pretty certain that a Scythian or Turanian government preceded
that which the traditions of ancient history, the statements
of the Bible, and the indications of the ruins unite in placing
at 2234 B. C. The founder appears as Nimrod, or Bilu-Nipur.
Many indications render it fairly certain that the early formative
stages of a kingdom had already passed, and that Nimrod
merely changed the capital. The first people had learned to
subdue their soil, had begun to build and to bring language
and art to some degree of order, when it appears that a Hamitic
race, more advanced than they, and showing strong likeness
to the early Egyptians, mingled with them. In the first
inscriptions the language is Turanian, but the character Hamitic,
or Egyptian. So far as can be judged, the displacement
was peaceful and gradual. About the time above named, a
man of great genius, Nimrod, a Hamite, or Cushite, as he is
termed in the Mosaic record, a “mighty hunter,” as his name
implies, founded a kingdom farther up the Euphrates, and on
the plain which lay between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The existence of the first empire is dimly made out,
and that is all. Nimrod had clearly a foundation to build on,
and he made a great impression on his own times. After his
death he was deified under the name of Bel, and became the
favorite among the fifteen or sixteen principal deities of the
early Chaldeans. These gods and goddesses seem to represent
the heavenly bodies; while the earlier Turanian worship was
a veneration of the powers of nature. Nimrod’s dynasty
appears to have covered a period of about two hundred and
fifty years, including the reigns of eleven kings. They made
great advancement in draining the marshy valley and regulating
the supply of moisture to the growing crops. They
became expert in the manufacture of cloths and in building
with bricks which are covered with inscriptions. The priesthood
acquired a strong development at this time, as appears
in the ruins and inscriptions of their temples. The kings do
not appear to have been very warlike, or to have extended
their dominion far.</p>

<p>3. A second Chaldean kingdom was founded about 1976
B. C. It is called Elam in the Bible, and furnishes the first
known example of what was afterward so often seen in that
region—an extensive kingdom formed by a series of rapid
conquests, that fell to pieces again as soon as a vigorous hand
failed to uphold it. The kingdom continued till about B. C.
1500. Kudur-Lagamer, the Chedor-Laomer of the Mosaic
account, overran a territory one thousand miles in length by
five hundred in width. In one of his incursions into Palestine
his forces were defeated by Abraham, which ended a control
over that region lasting twelve years. There is no indication
that the following sovereigns exerted authority beyond
Chaldea and Babylonia.</p>

<p>There, however, they grew rich and civilized, extending
their commerce to India and Egypt, becoming famous and
envied for their splendor and luxury. A single small dwelling
house of that period has been preserved in the ruins of
Chedor-Laomer’s capital “Ur of the Chaldees,” south of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Babylon. It was built on a platform of dried bricks, the
walls of great thickness, with two arched doors, and, apparently,
lighted from the roof. The rooms were long and narrow.
Iron was at that time unknown. All implements were
of stone or bronze. Religion seemed to increase in its grossness,
apparently under the policy of the priesthood, who laid
the foundation of astronomical science and began to acquire
the reputation for hidden knowledge for which they became
famous in after centuries. Nothing of any importance is
related of the kings of this monarchy except the one conqueror.
Despotism and priestly craft kept most of the feeble
tendencies to political improvement curbed—waiting for better
times. That arrived with the advent of the <i>Assyrian
Empire</i>, about B. C. 1500.</p>

<p>4. It appears that for a long time before, a family, or
tribe, of Shemites had been settled in Chaldea, where they
acquired its civilization and arts, and some time about B. C.
1600 emigrated north, settling on the river Tigris. They
were a strong race, physically and mentally, quite too fierce
and resolute to be held in leading-strings by the Chaldean
priesthood. The country they occupied was higher and more
varied, abundantly supplied with stone, which was wanting in
Babylonia and Chaldea.</p>

<p>Here, in process of time, the most vigorous and progressive
race that had yet been seen among the families of man, built
up a succession of cities within a small circuit, each of which
was, at different times, the capital, and which were all finally
united and made the famous Nineveh of the Greek historians,
and the immense “city of three days’ journey,” visited by the
Jewish prophet, Jonah. Within a few years these ruins have
been examined by competent men of science with great care,
and have been found to confirm the Bible narrative, in all
essential points, and most of the glowing descriptions of profane
historians; while their higher style of art and greater
vigor and pride of achievement led them to build monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and engrave records that promise to make us very intimately
acquainted with their social, political and moral life.</p>

<p>5. They seem to have acquired the habit in Chaldea of raising
a vast elevated mound for their more important buildings.
The largest mound is found to be nearly one hundred feet
high, and to cover an area of one hundred acres, and on the
summit of this were placed their temples and the palaces of
their kings. This immense foundation, it is said, would
require the labor of twenty thousand men for six years.
After this were to be constructed their vast buildings, covered
with sculptures and adorned with statues. Another
mound, higher but embracing a smaller area—about forty
acres—served the same purpose.</p>

<p>They were extremely religious in their way, but the vigor
of the kings appears to have overshadowed the priesthood
much more than in Chaldea. It seems to have been about
three hundred years after the establishment of this enterprising
stock in Assyria that they became famous for foreign
conquest. Babylon had been gradually rising in importance,
often in subjection, more or less nominal, to the growing
northern power, but retaining its own kings and habits.</p>

<p>6. The reign of Shalmaneser I., about 1290 B. C., was distinguished
by his building a new city and improving his
kingdom; and his successor, in 1270, signalized his reign by
establishing, for a time, a complete sovereignty over Babylon,
and the historical Assyrian empire is commonly dated from
that event. For a century and a half there are few important
records. Tiglath-Pileser I., in B. C. 1130, commenced a series
of efforts to extend his dominions by conquest, which his
success led him to describe with unusual detail. It embraces
five campaigns and a description of the conquest of all the
neighboring people. He established a compact and powerful
empire, which was surrounded by wild tribes whose conquest
was of little honor or value, and whom it was difficult to hold
long in subjection. In a return from a campaign against
Babylon, which he had conquered, he suffered a great reverse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
losing the images of his gods which he kept in his camp for
protection and assistance in his enterprises; and they were
carried to Babylon, remaining there, it is said, 400 years. A
long period of apparent quiet was followed, after more than
two hundred years, by another warlike king who pushed his
conquests to the Mediterranean sea. His public works were
larger and more magnificent than those of any of his predecessors.
He has recorded ten successful campaigns.</p>

<p>7. His son, Shalmaneser II., increased the number, extent
and thoroughness of the conquests of his father. Still, most
of the countries conquered retained their laws and government,
simply paying an annual tribute, and the conquest set
lightly on them. Babylon seems to have retained comparative
independence. In the following reign, Babylon was captured
and remained some time tributary to Assyria and the
Ninus, or Iva-lush IV., whose wife was the celebrated Semiramis,
still further extended Assyrian power. The wonderful
tales related by Grecian historians of Semiramis are not confirmed
by the monuments. She appears to have been an
energetic Babylonian princess, the principal queen of Ninus,
who ruled conjointly with him. The novelty of a female
ruler in that rude age, and the splendor of the empire at the
time, seem to have originated the fabulous tales related of her.</p>

<p>8. At this time the development of the people of all the
western parts of Asia was so great, and the wars as well as
peaceful intercourse of different nations had so stimulated
them all, that improvement kept a tolerably even step. Multitudes
of populous cities and kingdoms existed in all directions.
The magnificence of Solomon belongs to this period,
the Jewish monarchy having reached the height of its glory
and power, too high to be long endured by the proud and
enterprising Assyrians. Commerce filled the east with activity
and manufactures flourished, in some directions reaching
a high degree of excellence. A true progress marked the
general course of human effort. The psalms of David show
to what a lofty point the religious ideas of that age were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
capable of being carried. Industrial pursuits and agriculture
reached, in the next hundred and fifty years, the highest
development they ever attained in some regions.</p>

<p>9. In the midst of this busy industry Nineveh rose, peerless
in grandeur, enriching herself with the tribute and spoils
of all countries, beautified by the master race, which was wise
enough not to dry up the sources of their prosperity by the
destruction of cities and kingdoms. The common policy, up
to nearly the close of her splendid career, was to leave the
real resources of all conquered nations untouched. After
defeating her opposer in a battle, she received the submission
of the king, imposed a heavy tax, or forced contribution, and
an engagement to pay a definite annual tribute, and went on
her way to subdue another nation to a like formal control.
With misfortune, or a change of rulers in the dominant kingdom,
the subject-kings would withhold tribute, raise an army,
and the whole work of conquest had to be repeated.</p>

<p>Thus the empire consisted of a stable nucleus, Assyria, and
a vast floating mass of half independent kingdoms, states and
cities which were now submissive and now in revolt. We
may easily conceive how this comparatively mild mode of
warfare would contribute to the general advance of the whole
population. This mingling and clash of armies, surging to
and fro of vast bodies of men, and the knowledge and culture
received from the great and wealthy capital made the school
of that period for the education of humanity.</p>

<p>10. The Assyrian annals show a continued growth in
splendor and power and extent of dominion until the very
eve of its fall. In the course of that time Egypt was invaded
and partially subdued for the first time; and, in the impatience
of frequent revolt, the practice commenced of removing
whole nations from their original homes, supplying their
place by others. Thus the Ten Tribes were transported from
their homes in Samaria, and other nations brought to occupy
their places.</p>

<p>The last king of Assyria inherited an authority that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
extended farther and over larger numbers than had ever before
been known. The vigorous governing race were perhaps corrupted
and weakened by a thousand years of power and success;
but various extraordinary circumstances united to bring
on a sudden catastrophe. A considerable part of the central
kingdom was devastated by an irresistible host of Scythians,
immediately after which the Medians, who were as fierce and
warlike as the Assyrians in their best days, attacked Assyria.
A large army, sent by the king to meet the invaders, went
over to the enemy by the treachery of its general, Nabopolassar,
and the combined armies laid siege to Nineveh,
which fell, the king burning himself and his family in his
palace. Nineveh was destroyed, and Nabopolassar received
as his reward the kingdom of Babylonia, and the Assyrian
conquests in the south and west. He founded the</p>

<p>11. Babylonian Empire, which has made a greater impression
on posterity than Nineveh. He was a man of great
energy and resources. The treasures and captives of that
mighty city, that fell to his share, were employed in rebuilding
and improving Babylon. During his reign of twenty-one
years, and the forty-three years of his still more illustrious
son and successor, Nebuchadnezzar, that city was made
the wonder of the world. Each side of it was fifteen miles in
length, the river Euphrates passing through its center. They
repaired the wall, which was eighty-seven feet thick and more
than three hundred feet high. This wall was so immense
as to contain more than twice the cubic contents of the great
wall of China, which is 1,400 miles in length, and the vast
enclosed space was filled with palaces, temples, hanging gardens,
and all the impressive evidences of boundless power and
resources in which the gross ambition of that period delighted.
A second wall was built within the first, the river was, for a
time, turned out of its bed and its bottom and sides paved
with masonry, and huge walls erected on either bank; canals
and aqueducts, for agricultural purposes, of the most stupendous
character, were constructed all over the broad valley. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
wealth and energies of the richest and most populous part of
Asia, as then known, were employed to build up the great
capital and improve the central province.</p>

<p>12. The Jews were kept there, as captives, for seventy
years, all the treasures of their city and temple, and the
accumulated wealth of their nation, were poured into the
Babylonian treasury, and their people employed, with other
countless multitudes, in the construction of its walls and
buildings, and the cultivation of its fields. Tyre, the most
renowned commercial city of ancient times, was taken, after
a siege of thirteen years, and much of Egypt was reduced.</p>

<p>It was the culmination of the centralizing system of the
Assyrians and Chaldeans which had lasted for two thousand
years.</p>

<p>13. A dominion so resting on physical force, and gorged
with booty wrested from others, with no moral power or
national spirit underlying it, could not last long. A more
vigorous and warlike power rose by the union of the Persians
and Medes under the Persian warrior, Cyrus, who, after a
series of conquests farther north and west, in Asia Minor,
turned his arms against Babylon. The walls were impregnable,
but the river proved a source of weakness. It had been
once diverted from its course to pave its bed within the city;
the hint was accepted, and, on a night of feasting and carelessness,
it was again turned aside to give free entrance to the
besiegers, and the Babylonian Empire fell in the very height
of its pomp and glory. We find a regular progress in organization,
in most institutions, from the first Chaldean to the
last Babylonian Empire. In popular religion alone was there
an increasing grossness, which reached its limit about this
time by the fall of the Chaldean priesthood, purer practices
and ideas were circulated by the Jews in their captivity, and
the Magian religion was reformed by Zoroaster.</p>

<p>14. The Medo-Persian Empire lasted for 200 years. Those
nationalities were both of the Aryan or Indo-European race.
They had long been maturing on the highlands bordering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
north and east of Chaldea and Assyria, with which their connection
was close enough to communicate the general value of
the growing organization, but too slight to drag them down
to its level. They brought now, to the common stock of progress,
the freshness of youth and the healthy habits and pure
blood of the mountaineer. They had a higher capacity for
organization, by which the experience and progress of the
older nations, for more than two thousand years, was prepared
to profit. They had already subdued Asia Minor and their
vast Empire soon extended from India to the sea that washed
the shores of Greece. A complicated civil and military organization
consolidated this extensive region more perfectly than
before by armies and governors located in each nation and
principal city; a system of easy communication was introduced;
and the preparation for the higher Greek models of
thought, and the severe regularity of Roman institutions went
on apace.</p>

<p>15. Babylon fell gradually into decay, being only occasionally
the capital of the Persian Empire; the love of the sovereigns
of that race for their native highlands leading them to
build splendid capitals in the borders of their own country.
A reform of great significance occurred about this time in the
Persian national religion, which gradually displaced the debasing
superstitions and gross idolatry of all the nations of the
Empire.</p>

<p>The government was still despotic, somewhat relieved by
the more humane and independent habits and traditions of a
hardier race. A number of changes of dynasty by violence
occurred, but they were merely revolutions of the palace. The
vast wealth and power inherited from the subject empires
gradually corrupted the conquerors. Their armies became
vast crowds of comparatively undisciplined troops, who were
accustomed to bear everything before them by their irresistible
weight. Their conquests on the northern and eastern coasts
of Asia Minor brought them in conflict with the Greeks, who
had many colonies long settled in that region, and the Persians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
soon undertook to subdue that intelligent and independent
people. Their signal failure had the effect to greatly stimulate
the development of the Greek national spirit, and to awaken its
intellectual enthusiasm, and the mighty armies of the Persians
were destined to be annihilated by the small but resolute
forces of the little republics.</p>

<p>16. Thirteen sovereigns ruled during the continuance of the
Persian empire. Except the conquest of Egypt, they did not
very greatly extend the boundaries formed by Cyrus; but the
national features of the subject peoples were gradually effaced,
and the whole brought to the common level of civilization.
When Alexander, the great Grecian soldier, appeared with his
army of 35,000 men he scattered the hosts of the Persian
king, Darius, as the wind drives the leaves of the forest; and
the vast empire, so long accustomed to bow to the fate of battles,
became the unresisting heritage of the conquerer.</p>

<p>These five great monarchies were continuous—in part on
the same soil—the centre having always been the fertile valleys
of the Euphrates and the Tigris; the successor stepping
into the place and carrying out the general plans of his immediate
predecessor, but on a broader scale and in an increasingly
enlightened manner. Through all these long centuries a mysterious,
and, apparently, still more ancient race had occupied
Egypt, only occasionally interfering with, or being disturbed
by, the surging sea of strife that raged and foamed so near
them, which at length forced them from their seclusion and
bore them on in the general tide of improvement.</p>

<p>17. The Egyptian monarchy presents many very curious
and difficult problems. Possessing the most perfect organization
in the earliest times of which we have any knowledge, the
traces of its beginnings quite fail us, although, more than any
other nation, it loved to build great and impressive monuments
and record on them, in the most minute manner, the singular
habits and monotonous daily life of its people. The first of
those monuments, which, by many signs, must date very
nearly as far back in the remote past as the earliest dawn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
organization among any other people of whom we can gather
any certain traces, indicate a long settled state, a high degree
of organization, considerable culture and great resources.</p>

<p>18. The first king, who is called Menes by several independent
and very ancient authorities, made his reign memorable
by a system of vast and useful public works. It is conjectured
that the previous rulers were the sacerdotal class and
that, up to that time, they had no kings. The habits of the
people were quiet and peaceful, and they seem to have been
first gathered around temples. In all stages of their history,
down to the time when foreign intrusion by force disorganized
their peculiar institutions, the priesthood was the most influential
element in their constitution, and their sway seems to
have been, in some respects, singularly mild and beneficent.
Except for the extreme inflexibility and minuteness of their
regulations, which repressed all spontaneous growth, and the
gross and absurd worship of animals which they introduced,
they might be considered an unmixed blessing to those early
times. It is certain that they were successful in controlling
men and moulding them to their own views without producing
discontent or revolt.</p>

<p>19. Everything in Egypt was remarkable—its river, its
country, and the institutions and habits of its people. The
Egyptians dwelt in the valley of the Nile for a space of 500
miles above its mouth; but this valley was so narrow that the
habitable part of it contained only about 6,000 square miles in
all. It was shut in by the Red sea on the east and by trackless
deserts on the west, and a fall of rain was so rare as to be
considered a prodigy. In June each year their mysterious
river, whose sources are yet almost unknown, began to rise till
it covered the whole valley like a vast sea. The rise and fall
occupied the summer months and to the middle of October.
The waters left a rich coating of mud and slime, which rendered
the valley fertile beyond measure. The productive season
occupied the remainder of the year, and their agricultural
resources were only limited by their skill in spreading and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
husbanding the fertilizing waters. Vast canals and reservoirs
covered the whole valley. Lake Moeris, a reservoir partly
natural and partly artificial, was said by the first Greek historian,
Herodotus, to have been 400 miles in circuit. When
the waters had reached their highest point, the cisterns, canals
and lakes were filled and the waters kept in reserve for late
periods of the year, and a succession of crops.</p>

<p>20. The mysterious character of the river seems to have
deeply impressed the nation with awe and reverence for unseen
powers, and contributed to the influence of the priestly caste.
Their peculiar source of wealth and the amount of leisure
periodically afforded, perhaps led to the construction of the
temples and palaces, whose gloomy strength is as mysterious
as their river, or the origin of the people. Far back in the
twilight of time, Thebes, the “city of a hundred gates,” was
a colossal capital. Its vast temples and palaces were built on
a scale of grandeur that seems almost superhuman; yet, before
history begins its narrative in Greece, Thebes had had its youth,
its long period of splendor and glory, its hoary age, and was
already a thing of the past, and nearly in ruins; not by violence
or conquest, but by the natural transfer of the center of
activities to another region. Considering the small extent of
Egypt, its always overflowing population, and the tenacious
habits of the Egyptians, nothing could more impressively show
its great age.</p>

<p>21. Egyptian sculpture was descriptive of religious ceremonies
on the temples, and on the palaces of domestic life and
general habits, and furnishes us with details of the whole
social structure and all their industrial pursuits, as well as the
events in the campaigns of their few warlike monarchs. Add
to these the minute delineation of their temple service and
religious teachings, and its ruins describe the entire round of
its ancient life.</p>

<p>The people were divided into classes, or castes, the son being
obliged to follow the occupation of the father; and all branches
of business and industry, public and private, were arranged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the most methodical manner. The priest, the soldier, the husbandman,
the artisan of whatever branch, was so because his
ancestors had been such for numberless generations. A king
could be selected either from the priestly or the soldier caste;
but he must previously have been initiated into all the mysteries
of the priesthood, and therefore Moses, the acknowledged
heir of the throne, “was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.”
Otherwise, not belonging to the priestly caste, he must
have remained in ignorance. With this exception, the priest
alone had the key of knowledge, and all the employments
requiring intellectual studies, or scientific culture, as we should
now say, were filled from that class. They kept all records,
measurements, and apportionments of land; prescribed the
times, seasons, and conduct of all public transactions; were
the constitutional advisers of the king; they were physicians,
astronomers, philosophers, and guides of the people in every
respect. They alone did the thinking, and they guarded their
prerogative with the most jealous care.</p>

<p>22. A people are debased and gross in proportion to their
ignorance, and the ignorant masses of Egypt were amused
with the greatest possible multiplication of gods, and their
leisure and simple minds fully occupied in religious ceremonies
and absurd fictions. But the priests were as wise and
moderate as they were crafty and persistent. Their discipline
was extremely judicious and well administered, and was laid
on the king as well and sternly, as to his general life, as on
the lowest peasant. The priesthood were as absolute, as impartial,
and as unvarying from age to age as it is possible to
conceive. Their services to humanity were very great. They
laid the foundation among men, of unvarying law, of diligence
in the employment of time, of exactness in the division of
labor, and inculcated, in an effective way, the idea of divine
justice and of immortality.</p>

<p>23. Their “wisdom” was the highest and the most fruitful
that was, perhaps, possible in their times; their fame was
wide-spread, and their influence on the legislation of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lands has laid all ages under great obligations. The political
economy of the Jews was the product of one of their most
intelligent disciples, and the fact that he was so probably
added greatly to his influence and success with his own people;
and all the great legislators, philosophers, and historians of
Greece went to them to complete their education. In after
times, when the nation lost its liberty and became the province
of a distant kingdom, they sunk the priest in the scholar, and
Egypt had the largest libraries and the most eminent philosophers
in the world. After Greece was carried, as it were,
bodily, to Rome, far down into the Christian Era, Alexandria
was the university of the world.</p>

<p>The history of Egypt is thus entirely peculiar, being mainly
that of its own influential class. They impressed a peaceful,
generally virtuous, laborious, as well as monotonous character
on its history, and, besides the vast monuments which
the patient industry they inspired reared up, and the names
of their interminable list of kings, there was, perhaps, little
to record.</p>

<p>24. The entire number of their dynasties of kings, as they
have handed them down to us, is thirty-two, the last being
the Ptolemies, founded by a Greek general of that name, after
the death of Alexander the Great, which lasted more than
three hundred years, closing B. C. 44. The first twelve dynasties
are called the Old Empire, whose period it is impossible
to determine accurately. The five following dynasties are
ascribed to the reign of foreigners, called “shepherd kings,”
who are supposed to have established their authority between
the times of Joseph and Moses, and are called the Middle
Empire; while thirteen dynasties, including the royal families
that reigned down to the time of the conquest of Egypt by
the Persians, comprise the New Empire. They were generally
exclusive, shut up within themselves, too much absorbed in
exact observance of the endless routine prescribed by their
priests to be inclined to the ambition of foreign conquest;
but several of their kings gathered large armies and invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Palestine and Syria, or made a trial of strength with the
Assyrians or Babylonians. They never made permanent conquests
in that direction. Some of the later kings became
friendly to the Greeks, and employed them in their armies,
to the great disgust of their subjects, the soldier caste retiring,
almost in a body, to Ethiopia, and refusing to return.
The kingdom soon after fell into the hands of foreigners, and
the accumulated discipline, knowledge and wealth of that wise
people became the inheritance of humanity.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar was the first who made a conquest of
Egypt, but the country soon regained its independence. It
was not till after the death of Cyrus, and when the details of
the new Medo-Persian kingdom had been settled, that Cambyses,
the son of Cyrus, subdued the whole of Egypt, and
made it a Persian province, in which condition it remained
most of the time to the Grecian invasion.</p>

<p>25. About twenty-five hundred years before the time
of Alexander the Great, the cities of Sidon and Tyre were
founded, in Phenicia, on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean
sea. Their territory extended only twenty miles back,
from the sea. They were of the Semite race, and their enterprising
spirit led them to build ships and become at first
pirates and then merchants. They were thrifty and grew
rich, improved their vessels and became famous for their commerce.
They at length planted colonies for trading purposes
on the northern coasts of Africa, in Sicily and in Spain.</p>

<p>One of those colonies, Carthage, became more wealthy and
powerful than the parent state. The merchandise they gathered
from distant countries they distributed through Asia by
a land trade, and their caravans reached Nineveh, Babylon
and Persia, and, for long periods, were almost the only link
that joined Egypt to the rest of the busy and growing world.
They learned many useful things among the Egyptians, among
others the invention of letters, or at least hints on which they
improved. Many flourishing cities were built up by this
internal commerce in places surrounded by desert regions, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Baalbek and Palmyra in Syria, and Petra in Arabia, a city
excavated in the rocks, which, lying between Syria and Phenicia
in the north and the rich districts of Arabia in the
south, and between Babylon and Persia on the east and Egypt
on the west, became a great mercantile depot. The Phenicians
were the busiest and most enterprising people of ancient
times. Their vessels reached the shores of England, where
they had valuable mines of tin, as of silver in Spain; they
visited the northwest coasts of Africa and the Madeira islands,
and brought the rich products of India and gold from eastern
Africa to the markets of the world. The amount of their contributions
to civilization and progress by making known the
discoveries and arts of distant nations to each other, by causing
roads and inns to be built, and facilitating communication,
was immense; as well as by awakening the love of gain
and turning the activities of a part of mankind from warlike
to more peaceful and useful pursuits. The arts and inventions
that have done the most, in the long run, for the improvement
of men, as shipbuilding and writing, were communicated
from one nation to another. Their commercial routes were
the highways over which the intelligent and inquiring Greeks
traveled in search of the knowledge which they used for the
education of their people. Tyre was destroyed by Alexander
B. C. 332; but he replaced it the same year by building Alexandria,
at the mouth of the Nile.</p>

<p>26. We have thus seen nations and institutions gradually
unfolding, passing through a period of youth, of vigorous
organic action, and finally decaying, to give place to another
of higher order which inherited all its general gain and proceeded
to carry still further the banner of civilization. As
this process continues the field widens, and with the increasing
number and variety of the elements engaged in acting
upon one another, the product becomes more valuable,
the organization more complete and the institutions more
useful.</p>

<p>The institutions purely political, however, the modes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
government and the style of administering them, are imperfect,
at best. They are too arbitrary, too restrictive; the
masses are too large and too closely crowded to permit free
play to the component parts. The mingling of the whole
was, at first, evidently necessary to prevent the crystalizing
of the separate nationalities and the arrest of progress; but
when that process was stopped and a plastic condition and progressive
tendency assured, the absolute despotism of the king
and the priest stood in the way of advance. They had educated
society and developed its resources until a power of vast
combination had been gained; then a change must be introduced,
or the entire resources of the civilized world would be
employed to repress its further advancement, the fountains of
wealth would be exhausted and the springs of activity dried
up. This barrier against a destructive centralization had long
been preparing among the Grecian states.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_V">SECTION V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GRECIAN STATES.</span></h4>

<p>1. They were of the Aryan race, and showed a high
capacity to receive the lessons taught by the experience and
genius of all the past, and make them the stepping-stone to a
higher civilization and freer institutions. They were preceded
in the occupation of Greece by the Pelasgi, of the
same stock, but too rude and uncultured to leave many traces
of their presence except the ruins of immense cyclopean
buildings, without inscriptions, indicating only a dawning
culture, but a vigorous combination of physical force. The
mythic history of Greece is in part a veiled and distorted
account of the struggles of Hellens, or true Greeks, against
those uncouth aborigines; the actual facts being mingled by
the lively creative fancy of their poets with the religious traditions
brought from their original home. The highly picturesque
language of the primitive Aryan people accorded
with the imaginative and observant character of that family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and its inclination to extemporize some plausible
explanation of the natural phenomena which awakened their
attention, and, apparently, suggested the general course of invention
and embellishment adopted by the poets, who were the
historians, the theologians, and the only literary class of their
period. Thus the early speculations and crude religious ideas
assumed, in poetic hands, an exceedingly fanciful and marvelous
garb; and their heroes, who succeeded in overcoming the
difficulties of a new settlement, and in laying the foundation
of their communities in a rude country filled with men and
beasts almost equally wild and savage, were endowed by their
grateful and admiring descendants with superhuman qualities,
and wonder and reverence ascribed to them a descent
from the gods.</p>

<p>2. A characteristic feature of Grecian heroic mythology
is the number and mutual contests of these mythical heroes
which indicate a leading characteristic of the nation—a disposition
toward independence and decentralization. Every
small community had its divine hero, and insisted on maintaining
its government in its own hands. In the early times
the immediate descendants of these local benefactors commonly
obtained the sovereignty, more or less qualified, over
their city and community. They all greatly respected the tie
that bound them together in kinship as one race; but they
never would permit it to deprive them of local independence.
If they had a king he should be of their own tribe and choice;
if they were ruled with harshness it should be only because
they chose to submit to their own tyrant. They seldom permitted
another community to manage their internal affairs.
Various leagues were early formed among contiguous cities
or states closely related by origin; but they dealt only in
matters of common interest, and if one city or king was
acknowledged as the head, it was only in a general sense for
the sake of realizing some general plan.</p>

<p>3. This instinctive and resolute refusal to accept a centralized
government was a new and important feature in the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of men in a civilized, or highly organized state. It was
the direct opposite of that which characterized Asiatic and
African civilization, and held the Greek race open to a
spontaneous growth and a mental development which made
them the benefactors of the human family. With less individuality
and mental force, or a less favorable time and situation,
it would have kept them forever barbarous; but time
had matured them and the nations about them, and their
restless spirit of inquiry and constant movement among themselves
stood in the place of the foreign action and shock of
races that proved so beneficial and necessary to the Asiatics.
The Egyptian, Chinese and Hindoo peoples reached a certain
point of well regulated order, apparently by an original
impulse, and stopped; the Chaldean, Assyrian and Persian
races kept in the stream of progress by a sort of mechanical
or forcible stir and intermingling of races and civilizations;
and the principle accomplished, in each case, all it was capable
of. Time and progress then transferred the care of the best
interests of mankind to <i>intelligence</i> as embodied in the Greek
race. Without being conscious of such a high destiny, they
fulfilled it with fidelity, and remained true to themselves and
faithful to the impulses of their own minds until humanity
required training of a different kind, and another race, receiving
their mental culture, added to it administrative ability
and carried the old world as high as it could possibly go on
its ancient base.</p>

<p>4. It seems probable that about B. C. 2000, or in the time
of Abraham, the progenitors of the Greeks reached that country
from the highlands east of the Caspian Sea. Greece extends
about 220 miles from north to south, and 160 from east to
west, with a very irregular outline, and contains about 34,000
square miles, much of this being mountainous and barren.
The separation of the different states by these mountain
ranges much favored the disposition of the people to local
independence, and formed a bold and hardy race. Access from
three sides to the sea led to commerce and colonization, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it brought them into frequent contact with the most civilized
people of the east without endangering their independence,
and the lofty mountains on the north were an effectual barrier
to the irruption of the wild and wandering tribes of northern
Asia and Europe. Early in the history of the Greeks colonies
came from Egypt and Phenicia and introduced the arts of
those countries, then the most civilized in the world. This
was about the time that the Jewish nation was founded by
Moses, and we can easily understand that the native intelligence
of the Greeks and their teachable spirit, led them to
profit greatly by this early light.</p>

<p>5. The most celebrated traditions of this people relate to
an expedition by the collective young chivalry of Greece,
called the “Argonautic,” which indicates their enterprising
spirit and early acquaintance with the sea, and also seems to
have introduced the habit of planting colonies. Two wars
against Thebes, in the central part of Greece, induced by the
ambition and combinations of the kings of the various States,
seem to have made much impression on the whole nation,
while a combination of nearly all of its petty sovereigns, gathering
an immense army, stated at 100,000 men, to punish an
injury done to one of their number by the King of Troy, on
the opposite coast of Asia, occupied ten years, and filled the
whole country with confusion. This was soon followed by
an event called the Return of the Heracleidæ, or descendants
of Hercules—a mythic hero of great celebrity—to their
ancient dominion in the southern peninsula, called the Pelopenesus.
It appears to have been attended by the migration of
one tribe into the domains of another, which they forcibly dispossessed
and produced the emigration of the conquered people
into Asia, where they formed extensive colonies—independent—but
preserving a love for their race, and forming an
important element in Greek progress.</p>

<p>6. The commotions and miseries of this period and of
subsequent times, which had their rise mainly in this, most of
which were due to the restless ambition and personal quarrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of their kings, came at length to disgust the spirited and progressive
people with that form of government, and before the
time that authentic history begins they had very generally set
aside the kings and established a democracy; and where this
was not the case, as in Sparta, the power of the kings became
so limited that they were little more than leading magistrates
in their respective cities. This was not often done by violent
revolution, but generally in a quiet way, showing the steady
and intelligent resolution of the people.</p>

<p>This rare nation knew how to adapt its governments to its
needs. Not that everything went on without struggle or difficulty,
nor that they did not share in the rude and sanguinary
passions of their times. Their governments were often unsettled;
there were frequent conflicts among aspirants for place
and power in the state; they had a balance of power among
the leading states to maintain; and the want of a strong central
authority led to innumerable collisions and sometimes to desolating
wars. But amidst all the confusion and imperfection
of an early civilization they still maintained such an independence
of any superior in each state that they could settle their
internal affairs to suit themselves. They were yet uneducated
men, in the enthusiastic young manhood of the world, but
with spirit enough to be free.</p>

<p>7. That freedom had many defects. The true character of
freedom was imperfectly apprehended in that age of the
world. It was often violent; and much Grecian blood was
shed by Greeks. It was frequently turbulent; and sometimes
the strife of parties and factions did great injury to the welfare
of the state. It was usually a restricted liberty in which
all the inhabitants did not share, for the slave, the freedman,
and the foreigner were admitted to no influence in the government,
or in framing the laws; and there was always much
oppression and injustice somewhere. It was not a well understood
and well balanced liberty, as we comprehend it, but it
left room for a large amount of free and spontaneous action.
It made little account of the <i>individual</i>; that point was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
learned and made duly prominent after the lapse of more than
two thousand years. The Greek identified himself with his
state. He would not have it large in order that each free citizen
might have a personal influence in it. His public life
was an education to him; and the very defects of his institutions
fitted them more perfectly to meet the wants of that age
than anything more complete could have done.</p>

<p>8. They developed rapidly under a system so free from
restraint, coupled with a nature so ardent, and a thirst for
knowledge so absorbing. Still it was at least two hundred
years after they had re-arranged their primitive modes of government
before they reached a degree of order and system
that influenced them to record events as they passed, and
observe the world outside of their state, and even then their
most learned men wrote little. Men were absorbed in their
private matters, or in the affairs of the state. They thought
little of the future; they were devoting themselves diligently
to the only means of education that existed in those days,
intercourse and action. Their priesthood was quite different
from what we found it in Chaldea and Egypt. They did not
form a class, nor attempt to exercise an influence on government.
They were appointed from the body of the citizens
to offer sacrifices and conduct religious ceremonies. The
high spirited and active minded Greeks were not fit subjects
for the dominion of a priestly caste. Although Cecrops, an
Egyptian, settled and civilized Athens, and introduced some
of the social arrangements of his country, he did not plant
the all-controlling priesthood. The Athenians, of all other
Greeks, were the thoughtful, progressive intelligence of the
nation. The poets compiled the geneaologies and histories of
the gods, the heroes, and the past records of the people.
There was no other literature, there were no other sources of
information but those from which the poets drew—tradition
and inherited customs. Of these the poets explained the
origin and reason, and no one thought of questioning their
tales. They were supposed to be inspired; and their marvelous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
legends rested, to a certain extent, on monuments, habits,
and oral tradition. Their lively narratives charmed and satisfied
the public mind and gratified their pride. It was only in
later years that the philosophers explained them away.</p>

<p>In the early days they had no standard by which to criticise
them. All they required was that they should offer a pleasing
explanation. The wisest of the Greeks came, ultimately, to
believe in one God who ruled with wisdom and justice, and
they laid the foundation of all useful knowledge by teaching
men to think and reason; but true science was not possible in
their age of the world. They, however, prepared the way for it.</p>

<p>9. Their religion was cheerful and bright, they had altars
and temples in great numbers, and countless ceremonies in
honor of particular deities. One class of these was festivals,
or games, established, according to tradition, by their
divine heroes. The Olympian Games were the most celebrated,
and took place every fiftieth month at Olympia. In the year
776 B. C. they began to record the name of the victor in these
games, and as that was done ever afterward, this became a
fixed date and the interval between each was called an Olympiad.
It was the beginning of reliable history, although it was one
hundred and fifty years later that men of real wisdom, extensive
observation and careful study began to flourish. But the
eagerness with which the people sought information, and the
honor in which they held men of thought and wisdom, encouraged
study, reflection and travel for the sake of knowledge, so
that this class, in time, became extremely numerous.</p>

<p>Their researches, and systems of what they held to be truth,
were often imperfect, and, in many parts, false; but they were
upright and earnest in the studies that were then possible, and
did as much good, one might say, by their failures as by their
successes. Inquirers, in after times, noted <i>where</i> and <i>how</i>
they failed; so that all their pioneer work was useful—their
mistakes for a warning, their success for instruction.</p>

<p>10. The course of Grecian development took two contrary
directions, under the two leading states, Sparta and Athens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
The last represents the generally received idea of Greece—as
a land where the people were lively and beautiful, intelligent
and richly endowed with <i>taste</i> in the arts, or an exquisitely
quick and thorough <i>judgment</i> of <i>fitness</i>, developed to the very
highest point. Sparta, on the other hand, through its whole
career, was a military state. Somewhere about one hundred
years before the first Olympiad (B. C. 776), a lawgiver, named
Lycurgus, had reformed the institutions of the Spartan state
with the avowed and only object to render it capable of producing
the most vigorous and hardy warriors. He made an
equal distribution of lands, which were cultivated by the
ancient inhabitants, reduced to slavery. They were called
Helots, and were treated with great cruelty. Lycurgus abolished
every species of luxury, subjected the young, both boys
and girls, to the most rigorous training, and discouraged all
the amenities of family and social life that he supposed might
interfere with the rude hardiness of the soldier. The whole
intelligence, activity and vigor of the Greek mind was, in this
state, confined to military life. These institutions continued
to exist in Sparta for more than five hundred years. Among
any other race they would have secured to them the supreme
dominion of the nation; but among this liberty loving people
they merely sufficed to render them the general leaders in war,
and <i>one</i>, only, among the most powerful and respectable Greek
states. Besides, this experiment shows that there is little real
advantage in systematically trampling down the native instincts
of humanity in order to promote superiority in a particular
direction.</p>

<p>11. The entirely spontaneous character of the Athenians
made them, in general, the equal of the Spartans in military
fame, and gloriously eminent in many other directions. But
the various members of the Greek nation seem to have been
made, by their intelligence and the earnestness, the completeness,
of all their lines of development, the pioneers of humanity in
their experiments. They exhausted all the capacities of a complete
military education in an entire state, and presented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
most perfect achievements of a genius that had no models to
commence on, in poetry, in painting, in sculpture, in philosophy
and in such elements of science as were possible to humanity
in their day.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that most of the Greek colonies, the
Phenicians and their colonies, and a great part of the numerous
nations in Italy became republican about the same time—as
did the Romans later—and that those states which preserved
hereditary monarchy, or tyrants—as those kings were
called who were elected by the populace—had counterbalanced
the individual despotism of the kingly office by various institutions
that controlled and limited it.</p>

<p>12. At the period when history began to be carefully written
and dates accurately given, civilization was under full
career and rapidly moving westward. The Greeks had been
struggling with the difficulties of the early times for more than
a thousand years and had already begun to mature the institutions
and to show the traits of character that afterwards
made them so eminent and so useful in advancing the progress
of mankind. The Tyrians, or commercial people of Phenicia,
had formed the net-work of communication with all the parts
of the earth then sufficiently civilized to produce anything
which could be useful to the rest of the world, and Italy was
alive with the energies of the primitive races, mainly Aryan—some
of them transplanted from the East, and possessing
many of the highest elements of the ancient culture—who
fought the Romans with a vigor and persistence that contributed
much to the discipline and strong development of that
remarkable people, to whose instruction the Greek colonies
in eastern Italy added not a little.</p>

<p>From this point the advance of the center of development
toward the western continent, and of mental preparation for
more perfect ideals of government was continuous. A more
complete view of this progress will be gained by considering
the general events of each century apart, or in chronological
order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>13. B. C. 776. This is the first definite and positive date
in reliable history and commences the First Olympiad. The
Olympic religious and national festival was celebrated by foot
and chariot races, boxing, wrestling, etc., and was commenced
by religious sacrifices and ceremonies, mainly in honor of the
god Apollo. This peaceable assembly of all the representatives
of the Grecian race was one of the chief means of maintaining
the national union, and greatly promoted the maintenance
and importance of a kind of national congress, called
the Amphictyonic League. The first object of this League
was the protection of their common worship; but it came to
have, afterward, considerable importance as a political body;
its decrees having the character and force of the Laws of Nations
in modern times. It was composed of two delegates
from each of the twelve leading states of Greece, and held two
meetings yearly; one at Delphi, where was a celebrated temple
and oracle of Apollo, and one at Thermopylæ. The twelve
chief cities of the Æolian colonies of Greece in Asia Minor,
and also the same number of Ionian colonies on the same coast
more to the south, had each Amphictyonic, or International
Leagues; but the Greeks from all the various regions they
settled, as well as from the mother country, took a pride in
participating in the Olympic games.</p>

<p>14. B. C. 753. This is one of the most important dates in
the history of mankind. In this year, Rome, “The Eternal
City,” was founded by a band of adventurers and outlaws,
under the lead of the twin brothers, Romulus and Remus.
A spirit of adventure was the most characteristic feature of
that era, in Greece and about the Mediterranean sea, together
with a passion for colonizing, or founding new states. Education,
or growth, seems to pursue parallel lines in the same era,
so that the same general tendencies move the masses of widely
separated nations. Greece began, at this period, to send out
a large number of colonists, in rapid succession, to Italy and
the islands of the Mediterranean. The tendency had commenced
more than three centuries before, but the colonies had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
not gone far from the native state, and only one had been established
in Italy, at Cumæ. Carthage, a commercial colony
of the Tyrians, had been founded 127 years before, and was
now beginning to rival the parent city.</p>

<p>Rome gathered its population from all the neighboring
states. The mingling of races has always been favorable to
the progress of mankind. A single race, isolating itself and
receiving no new blood or impulses from without becomes
stationary and fixed in all its habits and advancement ceases
beyond a certain point. The men who founded Rome were,
apparently, a crowd of adventurers who had resolved to found
a state. After building the walls of their city and providing
themselves with habitations, they were destitute of wives—a
serious want which would soon leave their new city without
inhabitants. They remedied it in true Roman style—by violence.
They made a festival without the walls to celebrate the
founding of their state, and invited their nearest neighbors,
the Sabines, to take part in it. The Sabines came with their
wives and daughters. At a concerted moment the young
Romans each seized a young Sabine woman, and carried her
off into the city; the gates were closed and each proceeded to
make his captive his wife.</p>

<p>The Sabines were powerless to prevent the deed, but they
soon made war on their violent sons-in-law, and the young
city would have been destroyed but for the interference of the
stolen women who had become satisfied with the bold deed
which gave them valiant husbands. The Sabines were induced
to unite with the young state so far as to build a new city
adjoining and take part in its rising fortunes. Romulus was
elected king by his followers, but popular institutions were
established to limit his power, under the strong instinct of
vigorous organization that, from the first, characterized the
new nation. The people maintained their right to make laws
in conjunction with the king, and preserved a limited monarchy
for 250 years. At this time the prophet Isaiah flourished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in Judea, and the kingdom of Samaria was approaching
extinction.</p>

<p>15. B. C. 747. The Chaldeans established, or revived, their
dominion in Babylon, under their king, Nabonassur, and seem
to have been independent of Assyria for a time, but afterward
to have been brought into a qualified subjection to that
enterprising monarchy. It commences authentic history in
the East, so far as well ascertained dates are concerned. In
that year the Chaldean astronomers or priests, first introduced
the Egyptian solar year, which furnished an accurate mode of
measuring time. This was about the commencement of the
Sixth Olympiad. Egypt was approaching its most perfect
condition under its ancient system.</p>

<p>B. C. 743. Messenian war of 23 years—Sparta conquers
Messene.</p>

<p>16. B. C. 735. A colony from Corinth founded the celebrated
city of Syracuse in Sicily, and a fashion of colonizing
seems to have obtained in Greece, which continued for a hundred
years. The native enterprise of the Greeks, the great
increase of inhabitants in their small territory, and the commotions
and contests of parties in their states, which preceded
the establishment of more complete popular governments,
were probably the ruling causes of these foreign emigrations,
and all contributed to the increase of knowledge, improvement
in navigation, and the prevalence of a commercial spirit. Miletus,
the leading Greek city of Ionia, in Asia Minor, became
almost as powerful and prosperous by her commerce as Tyre
in her best days. There were Grecian colonies on the coast of
Africa west of Egypt, on the eastern coast of Italy, several in
Sicily, one in France. They were, generally, very enterprising
and prosperous, and diffused Greek intelligence and culture
over a large part of the world as known at that time. They
usually established a republican government. Syracuse remained
republican for 251 years.</p>

<p>17. B. C. 728. The Assyrian Empire was now having its
palmiest days, and spreading its dominion over all the central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
parts of western Asia, from the Mediterranean to the Persian
Gulf. At this time Shalman-assur, or Shalmaneser, the king
of Assyria, led away the Ten Tribes of Israel into a hopeless
captivity, and planted a different race in Samaria. Soon after
this time the Ethiopians from the upper Nile established their
dominion in Egypt, without apparently changing the general
condition of things there. Three Ethiopian kings successively
reigned in Egypt, and made conquests in Asia to some extent.</p>

<p>18. B. C. 600. About the beginning of this century the
foundation of Greek philosophy was laid by Thales of Miletus,
a Greek city in Asia. He represents the growth and acuteness
of the Greek mind and the approach of its period of greatest
activity. He travelled into Egypt in search of wisdom, and
was the most able astronomer of his times. He calculated an
eclipse of the sun, which, coming on just when two armies,
the Median and Lydian, were about to engage in battle, so
terrified them that they immediately separated and made peace.
He was celebrated as a mathematician, and taught many truths
concerning the existence of God which were far in advance of
his time, and undertook to account for the origin of all things
in a very bold and independent manner. He was one of the
famous “Seven Wise Men” of Greece. Solon was held to be
the first among the seven. He was an Athenian law-giver and
writer, and established a very wise and enlightened system of
government in Athens. He was a pure-hearted and clear-sighted
man, enjoying the universal respect of the Greeks.
Chilo, another of the seven, was a Spartan magistrate, held in
the highest esteem for his wisdom. Pittacus of Mitylene, was
a law-giver, held in high honor. Bias of Priene, in Ionia,
was a very noble-hearted and public-spirited citizen, of universal
reputation for wisdom. Cleobulus, of the island of Rhodes,
was remarkable for his skill in answering difficult questions,
and Periander of Corinth, the ruler, or tyrant, of that place,
was the last of the seven. They were all living at the same
time. They were only the most eminent among a people who
could fully appreciate mental ability. The spirit of inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
continued to spread rapidly for two hundred years, when the
greatest masters, who immortalized themselves and their race
by their genius, appeared.</p>

<p>19. In the early part of this century the kingdom of
Lydia, in the central part of Asia Minor, rose to great wealth
and power. The Lydian kingdom was ancient—many of its
customs being similar to those of the Egyptians—and the
Etrurians of Italy, a much more polished and cultivated
people than the Romans who conquered them, are thought,
by some eminent historians, to have been a Lydian colony
planted in Italy in unknown times. The Lydian kings made
war on the Asiatic Greek colonies and reduced many of them
to subjection. Crœsus, the last king of Lydia, was proverbial
for his vast wealth. He was conquered by Cyrus, the
Persian, in the middle of the next century.</p>

<p>679 B. C. Numa, the second king of Rome, is said to have
died. The Romans abstained from war during nearly the
whole of his reign, which was occupied in settling the internal
affairs of the new state, especially those relating to
religion. He was followed by Tullus Hostilius, a very warlike
prince, who did much to extend the Roman state.</p>

<p>20. About 650 B. C. a great change was introduced into
Egypt, by Psammeticus, its king, who, having several rival
claimants to the throne, employed the services of Greek soldiers
to overcome them. For the first time the country was
freely opened to foreigners, and the power of the priesthood
broken. Thus the Greeks were instrumental in changing the
current of Egyptian history.</p>

<p>The Median Kings began to make head in the east, and
ventured—after various successful efforts to extend their
dominion in other directions—to make direct war on Nineveh.
At the close of the century, by the aid of the rebellious
Nabopolassar, they succeeded in taking and destroying
that city, and the whole of that immense empire was divided
between Media and Nabopolassar, who made Babylon his
capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>21. B. C. 590 to 500. Events in this century begin to
crowd thick upon each other. The Greeks rapidly advanced;
the Romans succeeded, amid constant wars, in securely establishing
their state in Italy, marching from conquest to conquest,
not without heavy reverses at times, from which they
soon recovered.</p>

<div class="chronology">

inhabitants had built another city on an island near
by, but inaccessible to the conqueror, and left him a
barren conquest.</p>

<p><span class="date">560—</span>The most memorable event that followed was the union
of Media and Persia under the military prowess of
Cyrus. He first employed the forces of the Medo-Persian
kingdom in Asia Minor, conquering Lydia
and the rest of that region,
<span class="date">549—</span>and dethroning Crœsus. Babylon and Egypt had both
entered into an alliance with Crœsus against Cyrus,
but before they could send Crœsus effectual aid Cyrus
had triumphed. He then turned his arms against
Babylon
<span class="date">538—</span>which he took by stratagem after a long siege. Egypt
was afterward obliged to become tributary to the universal
conqueror.</p>

<p><span class="date">534—</span>Cyrus, who had before been the Persian general of the
united armies under the Median king, Cyaxares, who
was his maternal uncle, succeeded to the kingdom, and
soon after sent the Jews home to their native land.
During this period the Greeks swarmed on the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
part of the Mediterranean sea and carried on nearly all
its commerce, the Tyrians being mainly confined to the
trade with India, Arabia and the various parts of the
Persian empire.</p>

<p><span class="date">529—</span>Occurred the death of Cyrus, full of years and glory.
History has described him as the most amiable of all
the great conquerors. He was succeeded by his son,
Cambyses, who, to punish the revolt of the Egyptians
<span class="date">525—</span>invaded that country and made it a Persian province.</p>

<p><span class="date">522—</span>Cambyses died and was succeeded by a Persian nobleman,
Darius Hystaspes, the line of Cyrus being extinct.
He finally broke the power of the priesthood in his
dominions, which perished at once in Egypt and Babylon,
where they had so long reigned supreme over the
minds of men.</p>

<p><span class="date">515—</span>The second temple was dedicated at Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="date">510—</span>In this year occurred a very important event in Roman
history—the establishment of the republic. Kings
had reigned there two hundred and forty-three years.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="SECTION_VI">SECTION VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.</span></h4>

<p>1. The Romans, more than any other people of ancient
times, understood how to establish a well ordered state. Respect
for order and law among them was very great. The idea
of a government with a definite constitution, which the rulers
should always respect, and which should be an adequate bulwark
to the people against oppression, had never occurred to
any of the Asiatic nations. The nearest approach to it among
the Greeks was in Sparta; but as their aim was directed, not
so much to the general welfare of the state as to training a
race of soldiers, their experiment was a failure. The Greeks
had a great impatience of subjection; they had no great ambition
to rule, but were impulsive, and each state wanted freedom
to pursue its own particular fancy. Their exhaustless energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and acute minds were devoted to the pursuit of ideal objects.
Even the sober and resolute Spartan put aside every other consideration
in order to realize his idea of a well formed, thoroughly
trained, and invincible warrior. Weakly and deformed
children were destroyed in their infancy, by order of the
state. The young women were subjected to the most rigorous
physical training, that they might become mothers of hardy
children. Physical training was one of the passions of all
Greece, originating in their delight in beauty and symmetry
of person. Sports that contributed to this were as pleasing
to the Greeks as to our modern school-boys.</p>

<p>2. Athens, which most perfectly represented the Grecian
mind, esteemed a fine poet, an able writer, a skillful painter
or sculptor, as much as an enthusiastic scholar of our day can
do. They had a passion for beauty, and their love of liberty
was in great part produced by their ardent longing for mental
freedom and the gratification of their mental tastes. The worship
of their gods was chiefly their admiration for superhuman
majesty, sublimity, and beauty, as they conceived them,
and their theology was compounded of their thirst for
knowledge and their love of the mysterious, the grand, the
terrible, and the beautiful. Life was of no value to them,
if they could not gratify these instincts, and their tenacity
in maintaining their liberties found its inspiration in them.
They were a nation of mental enthusiasts. They had no
love of conquest for the sake of power. They were invaded
by the Persians, and a handful of Greeks conquered its immense
hosts with ease, by their intelligence and ardor. It
was only when they saw the splendor and wealth of the
East, and felt that they could repeat the glorious deeds of
their mythic heroes, that they became enthusiastic over the
romantic idea of conquering a magnificent empire. It was
the mental charm of the undertaking that gave to Alexander
his miraculous success.</p>

<p>But the Greeks were not practical. They wanted worldly
wisdom. The Lacedemonians of Sparta had no adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
object when they sacrificed almost all that common humanity
holds dear, to rear up model soldiers. Their ambition
was confined mainly to preserving the headship of their
state among the petty republics of Greece; and the resources
of all the states were wasted in the effort to preserve a balance
of power among the various members of the nation; or
in struggles of the more powerful to obtain a leading influence.
They had little political wisdom, when the independence
of their territories was secured and the governments
that restrained them too much from their favorite enthusiasms
were abolished. Athens and all Greece admired immensely
the wise measures of Solon, when he reformed the government
and gave it excellent laws. But they had not the prudence
to maintain them. In ten years all was again confusion. Most
of their great men who possessed a special genius for government,
were abandoned when they showed the most ability for
benefitting their country by their wise statesmanship. Pericles
alone, who was the most perfect embodiment of Grecian
character, preserved his influence to the last; but it was
by falling in perfectly with the tone of Grecian feeling, and he
laid the foundation of innovations that corrupted and finally
overthrew their liberty. He was as little practical and prudent
as his countrymen. Beautiful in person, cultivated in mind,
possessed of exquisite taste in literature and art, to which he
devoted himself with boundless enthusiasm, Greece could
always appreciate him. His age was the glory and joy of
Greece; but when more homely political virtues were required
to preserve his creations and protect this literary and artistic
state, the people could not follow them. Their best statesmen
were ostracised, banished, or slain, when their practical genius
was most needed.</p>

<p>3. Rome was the opposite of this. She had a genius for
producing and preserving a constitution, adding to it by slow
degrees, maintaining checks and balances that preserved the
machinery in working order, and rendered it capable of producing
the most valuable results that were possible in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
times. To rule was her passion. She was not wanting in
intelligence, but it was the homely prudence of common life,
the skill to adapt means to ends. Of all the nations, she
was the first to carry organization into every part of her
government, and conduct everything by inexorable system
and order. If Rome was resolved to rule others, she was no
less resolved to rule herself. The mission of Greece was in
the domain of thought, to develop the intellectual capabilities
of mankind. That of Rome also required intelligence,
but of a lower and more material kind. She was to teach
mankind to follow an orderly development, to introduce
system, to prevent ruinous clashing of interests, to teach
respect for law. Greece taught the world to think to purpose;
Rome to govern with effect. Each served an important purpose.
Without either the world was not prepared for Christianity,
which added moral order, nor for true science, which
was the mature fruit of these three, and prepared the perfect
civilization which was to be developed to its conclusion in a
New World.</p>

<p>4. Rome commenced, not with the king, but with the
<i>Senate</i>—a body of experienced men, who made the laws and
appointed a king to administer them. The king, except in
time of war, was only the executive, the chief magistrate.
The later kings were restive under this restraint and sought
to place themselves above law, and the Romans at once dismissed
them, appointing various officers to fill their place.
The fundamental principles of government were not changed at
all, or very little, except by the subsequent course of development.
The Romans knew how to adapt their invincible spirit
of order to all changing circumstances, and when external
changes arose corresponding changes were developed, in a
regular manner, within.</p>

<p>Thus the Roman <i>spirit</i> was constant under the regal government,
throughout the republic, and to the close of the
empire, and had then become so thoroughly established in
laws and institutions as to govern the development of the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
states that rose out of its ruins and produced modern civilization.</p>

<p>At first the Roman government consisted only of the Senate
and the king. The Senate was chosen from the body of citizens,
and represented them. In the course of time the
descendants of the first people became the aristocracy, called
patricians, who enjoyed great privileges. A class was gradually
formed called the <i>plebs</i>, or common people, who, for some
time, had no share in the government. The patricians alone
could hold office, and marriage between them and plebians
was illegal. But, says an able writer, “the Roman commons
were the greatest commons the world ever saw, except the
commons of England and America.” In the course of time,
by wise and prudent management, and taking advantage of
favoring circumstances, resulting from the fact that they supplied
the body of soldiers to the state, without revolution,
breaking the laws, or violating the ancient constitution, they
obtained changes or additions to it, one after another, until
they had acquired a due influence in the conduct of affairs
and became fully a match for the patricians. It was a new
lesson to mankind, and one that has had great influence on
the good order of society in all later times.</p>

<p>5. The religious system of that great people was conducted
with as much worldly prudence as all their other affairs.
Their religious ceremonies were, in great part, derived from
the Etruscans. They were conducted with much pomp by
state officers, appointed for the purpose, embodying all the
superstitions of the time, and embracing comparatively little
of the lofty sentiment that was so prominent in Greece.
Their religion was an affair of state, and intimately connected
with the political working of the government. The gravest
public business was made to depend on the flight of birds,
on omens and accidents, and on the appearance of the entrails
of the animals offered in the sacrifices. An artful use of these
circumstances enabled the officers in power to compass many
political ends. Their original gods were those of Greece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
adapted to their purposes and national character; but they
readily adopted the divinities of all the nations they conquered.
Their religion was in a high degree cool and calculating.</p>

<p>The preceding observations apply especially to the periods
of Greece and Rome when their peculiarities were most fully
developed in the days of their greatest glory. Though always
more or less characteristic, in later times they melted more or
less into one another, or were toned down and transformed by
decay and a rising spirit of innovation. Especially were they
displaced by Christianity.</p>

<span class="smaller">GREECE AND ROME.</span></h4>

<p>1. We are now prepared to return to the year</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">500 B. C.—</span>and follow events in chronological order, with a
fair appreciation of their import. Just before the
close of the last century, Darius Hystaspes, the king of
Persia, sent an army into Europe, to the north of
Greece, to chastise the Scythians, and it conquered
Thrace. The Greek colonies in Asia Minor, which had
been recently added to the Persian empire, became
restive under foreign control, and when the Persian
army returned home,
<span class="date">500—</span>organized a rebellion and took and burned the city of
Sardis, the ancient capital of Lydia. They were assisted
by the European Greeks; but the vast resources of Persia
soon enabled Darius to take vengeance on them, and
Miletus was besieged and destroyed. Darius summoned
the Grecian states to offer their submission, but
Athens and Sparta sent back a defiance. Darius thereupon
gathered a large armament and prepared to invade
<span class="date">495—</span>Greece, which he commenced by the conquest of Macedon.
But a tempest destroyed his ships and 20,000
men, and the expedition returned to Persia. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
same year the Roman plebeians obtained their first success
against the patricians, by which the debts of the
poor plebeians to the wealthy patricians were cancelled
and Tribunes of the People appointed.</p>

<p><span class="date">490—</span>This year the glory of Greece broke forth. Darius
having sent another and larger army into Greece, it
advanced on Athens and encamped at Marathon, within
twenty-two miles of the city. The Persian host was
said to number from 100,000 to 200,000 men. The
Athenians had but 10,000 citizens, but armed 20,000
slaves, and the city of Platæa sent them 1,000 troops.
Miltiades, the very able Athenian general, marched out
and, taking a good position, offered battle. It was the
20th of September. The little army of the Greeks
obtained a complete victory and the Persians returned
home in confusion. The great services of Miltiades
were rewarded with imprisonment, on a frivolous
charge, and he died there of his wounds.</p>

<p><span class="date">485—</span>Darius Hystaspes, the Persian king, died while preparing
a still larger armament for the invasion of Greece.</p>

<p><span class="date">484—</span>An insurrection in Egypt completely subdued by the
Persians.</p>

<p><span class="date">480—</span>Xerxes, king of Persia, invaded Greece with a million
soldiers. The battle at the pass of Thermopylæ was
fought by a thousand Spartans under Leonidas, their
king, and all but one slain. The Persian fleet was beaten
the same day by Themistocles, the Athenian admiral.
Xerxes soon advanced on Athens, which was abandoned
by its inhabitants and burned by the Persians. Soon
after, Themistocles fought the Persian navy again at
Salamis and totally destroyed it. Xerxes, leaving a
large army in Greece, returned to Asia.</p>

<p><span class="date">479—</span>The battle of Platæa ended the Persian invasion. The
allied Greek army numbered 70,000, under Pausanias,
the Spartan king; the Persians 300,000. The Persians
are said to have had 200,000 slain, and their army was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
totally routed. Another victory was gained on the
coast of Asia Minor the same day, and the last remnants
of the Persian fleet destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="date">478—</span>Athens was rebuilt and surrounded with walls from the
treasures of the conquered Persians. This was the age
of great men in Greece. Phidias, her greatest sculptor,
flourished at this time. The Persians, at the time of
their first invasion, brought a piece of marble to commemorate
the victory of which they were confident.
The Greeks caused Phidias to produce out of it a statue
of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, and set it up on
the field of Marathon.</p>

<p><span class="date">478—</span>Themistocles died in banishment about this time, and
Aristides of old age. Both were leading statesmen and
generals of Athens during the Persian war.</p>

<p><span class="date">470—</span>Socrates, the most eminent philosopher of all ancient
times, was born this year.</p>

<p><span class="date">” —</span>The death of Xerxes by assassination occurred this year.</p>

<p><span class="date">466—</span>Cimon, son of Miltiades, was now the great man of
Athens. He was soon superseded by Pericles. From
480 B. C. to 430 was the golden period of Athens. She
was pre-eminent politically, conducting the war of the
Grecian allies against Persian supremacy on the western
shores of Asia and in the Mediterranean sea. Republican
liberty was everywhere predominant. The greatest
writers, painters and sculptors lived in this period
or immediately after it. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,
philosophers; Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, tragic
poets; Zeuxis and Apelles, painters; and Phidias in
sculpture, were a few among the many great names
which are found in or immediately following this period.</p>

<p><span class="date">457—</span>Cincinnatus was made dictator at Rome. During this
period the Romans laid the foundation of their dominion
over all Italy by waging successful war with the
Etruscans and Samnites, the most vigorous and powerful
of their opponents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">450—</span>The Decemvirate was appointed at Rome. They were
ten magistrates empowered to produce a more perfect
code. It was called the “Laws of the Twelve Tables.”
The plebeians about this time succeeded in wresting
important privileges from the patricians, which more
equally balanced the different powers of the state.</p>

</div>

<p>2. Athens was the centre of civilization, and Greek culture
and ideas were penetrating all the nations in her vicinity.
Rome was rapidly developing and Carthage was at the summit
of her glory. She had control of much of the Spanish or
Iberian peninsula. Persia, after absorbing all the old monarchies
of the east, was declining. The “march of empire”
was distinctly defining its “westward course.”</p>

<p>It was about the middle of this century that Herodotus, the
“Father of History,” was rising to fame, and a few years later
Xenophon, the Greek general and historian, was born. Thucydides,
another historian, dates from this period. The great
career of history now fairly commenced.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">443—</span>Herodotus emigrated from Halicarnassus, in Asia, to
Greece.</p>

<p><span class="date">431—</span>The Peloponnesian war, a bitter contest between Athens
and Sparta, commenced. It lasted twenty-three years,
and was again revived, ending in the conquest of Athens
by Sparta. This war was followed, after some time, by
the rise of the power of Thebes, under their famous
general, Epaminondas, who broke the power of Sparta.
Thebes sunk into insignificance after his death, and
Philip of Macedon commenced the subjugation of all
Greece. He was followed by Alexander the Great, who,
in return for the loss of republican liberty, rendered
Greece illustrious by conquering the Persian empire,
and imbuing all the Eastern World with its philosophy
and arts. For all these great events one hundred years
were required.</p>

<p><span class="date">429—</span>The death of the illustrious Pericles occurred in this
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">” —</span>Plato, the disciple of Socrates, and, in some points,
superior to him in mental discipline, was born.</p>

<p><span class="date">420—</span>About this time Alcibiades, the nephew of Pericles,
became prominent in Athenian affairs. He had brilliant
powers, but little principle.</p>

<p><span class="date">406—</span>The battle of Ægospotamos, gained by Lysander the
Spartan, broke the power of Athens.</p>

<p><span class="date">404—</span>Athens was taken by Lysander, its walls demolished,
and the government of the “Thirty Tyrants” established
by the Spartans. Alcibiades, banished from
Athens, was assassinated by the Persians, at the instigation
of the Spartans.</p>

<p><span class="date">401—</span>Occurred the battle of Cunaxa, in Babylonia, between
Cyrus, the brother of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, and
that king. Cyrus, who had been governor, or satrap, in
Asia Minor, gathered a large army including more
than 10,000 Greeks. Cyrus was killed and his own
army defeated, but the Greeks repelled all assaults.
Their generals having been decoyed into the power of
the Persians, on the plea of making terms with them,
were treacherously slain. The army appointed other
commanders, chief among whom was Xenophon, afterward
the celebrated historian, and they made good their
return to Greece. It was finely described by Xenophon,
and known as the “Retreat of the Ten Thousand.”</p>

<p><span class="date">400—</span>Socrates taught doctrines too pure and high-toned for
his countrymen to understand, and was condemned to
drink poison, as a dangerous man and despiser of the
gods, in the 70th year of his age. The Athenians soon
repented it.</p>

<p><span class="date">396—</span>The capital of Veii, taken by the Romans, ended the
contest with the Etruscans.</p>

<p><span class="date">389—</span>Rome was conquered and, except the capitol, destroyed,
by the Gauls under Brennus. The barbarians soon
retired and the city was rebuilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">384—</span>Aristotle, the most learned of the Grecian philosophers,
was born at Stagira, in Macedon. He laid the foundation
of scientific study, and was the tutor of Alexander
the Great.</p>

<p><span class="date">371—</span>Epaminondas defeated the Spartans at Leuctra, and
<span class="date">362—</span>again at Mantinea, where he was killed.</p>

<p><span class="date">360—</span>Philip became king of Macedon, and soon began to
undermine the liberties of Greece in a very artful way.</p>

<p><span class="date">357—</span>The “Sacred War” against the Phocians, who had
plundered the temple of Apollo, at Delphi, commenced.</p>

<p><span class="date">356—</span>Birth of Alexander the Great. Rutilius, the first plebean
dictator at Rome.</p>

<p><span class="date">349—</span>Death of Plato, the brightest light of Grecian philosophy.
He systematized and enlarged the doctrines of
Socrates.</p>

<p><span class="date">338—</span>Occurred the battle of Chaeronea between Philip and
the allied Athenians and Thebans. The Greeks were
totally defeated and their liberty lost. Demosthenes,
the most celebrated orator of the Greeks, spent his
whole life and his magnificent eloquence in the effort
to rouse the Greeks against Philip; but Philip was too
crafty and the Greeks too little accustomed to act in
concert. For nearly a hundred years the states of
Greece had been exhausted by wars among themselves,
and they were too weary of fighting to make the necessary
effort against so powerful and skillful an adversary.</p>

<p><span class="date">336—</span>Philip was assassinated on the eve of an expedition
against Persia, as chief of the Grecian states. This
popular idea consoled them for the loss of liberty.
Alexander succeeded his father.</p>

<p><span class="date">335—</span>Thebes rebelled against Alexander, and he took and
destroyed that ancient city.</p>

<p><span class="date">334—</span>Alexander carried out the project of his father and
invaded the Persian empire. The battle of the
Granicus, his first great victory, took place this year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">333—</span>Darius, the Persian king, was again thoroughly defeated
in the battle of Issus. Damascus, in Syria, was taken
and Tyre besieged by Alexander.</p>

<p><span class="date">332—</span>Tyre was taken and finally destroyed, and Alexandria,
at the mouth of the Nile, founded.</p>

<p><span class="date">331—</span>A final battle at Arbela, in Assyria, overthrew the
Persian Empire. Darius escaped, but was murdered
by Bessus, one of his officers. Four years were spent
by the Greeks in subduing the wild tribes on the eastern
border of the Empire, and settling the government
of these vast conquests.</p>

<p><span class="date">327—</span>Alexander invaded India and was constantly triumphant
till his soldiers refused to go farther from home.
They had grown tired of conquering, and Alexander
reluctantly returned to Babylon to consolidate his government.</p>

<p><span class="date">323—</span>Alexander died of a fever, the result of excessive drinking.
He left no heir, and his generals divided his
empire.</p>

<p><span class="date">322—</span>The Samnites obtained a temporary success by surprising
a Roman army in a narrow defile of the mountains
called the Candine Forks, and subjected it to a humiliating
capitulation. The Romans never bowed before
misfortune or defeat. They prosecuted the war with
invincible resolution until the Samnite power was
wholly broken, a contest, in all, of about 50 years,
which was soon followed by the complete subjugation
of the whole peninsula.</p>

</div>

<p>3. In this year died the two greatest Grecians, Demosthenes,
the orator, by suicide; and Aristotle, by old age. On
the death of Alexander, Demosthenes aroused the Athenians
to make a stand for their liberties. Few of the Grecian states
joined them and they were totally defeated by Antipater, the
governor appointed by Alexander. Demosthenes avoided
punishment by taking poison. The Achaian League, about
forty years after, maintained the liberties of Greece for fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
years or more, which then fell before the invincible Romans.
For many years all the eastern world was in confusion from
the struggles of competitors for the Empire of Alexander.
Ptolemy established himself soon and firmly in Egypt, and
Seleucus, after various</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">312—</span>Reverses, obtained full possession of the eastern parts
of the empire, Babylonia, Assyria and Persia. This
year is called the era of the Seleucidæ. Asia Minor
and Greece were a scene of the greatest confusion for
seventy years, so far as rulers were concerned. But
nearly all these were Greeks, and Greek culture and
philosophy exerted a wide spread influence. In the end
it became fully evident that the want of genius in the
Greek mind to organize, and steadiness in Greek character
to sustain, settled institutions was absolute. They
had, at different times, men of the greatest ability, but
when they passed away their plans and institutions
perished with them. The acute and accomplished
Greeks were ever children in the science of government,
and the advent of Rome alone, whose special
skill was in government, saved the world from irretrievable
anarchy or fatal despotism.</p>

<p><span class="date">300—</span>The Roman plebeans completed their struggle for constitutional
liberty by acquiring a share in the priestly
office, which was essential to the full value of their
other victories over the patricians, and the Roman constitution
was complete. It was maintained very fairly
for more that one hundred and fifty years, when the
spoils of their conquests corrupted the virtue of the
citizens and produced the internal disorder that, about
a century later still brought about the establishment of
the Roman Empire. Yet the forms of government,
municipal and other regulations, and the administration
of justice, though often interfered with in particular
cases, were so well settled on sound principles, and
secured so uniformly the welfare of society, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
were preserved longest from general ruin, and revived
first in more modern times. Greek thought and culture,
and Roman law remained indestructible.</p>

<p><span class="date">290—</span>The Samnites, Sabines and Gauls, being all defeated,
Rome was virtually mistress of Italy, although the
Grecian cities on the eastern coast remained to be subdued.
They had little strength in themselves against a
power so warlike, and invited Pyrrhus, the king of
<span class="date">281—</span>Epirus, to their assistance. He twice defeated the
Roman consuls, but they inflicted on him so much
loss that they vainly offered him battle immediately
after, and rejected all his overtures to treat for peace.
He was at length vanquished and obliged to abandon

<p>4. The Romans soon subdued all opposition and began to
look about for other lands to conquer.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">264—</span>The Carthaginians, on the opposite coast of Africa, had
become a colossal power, and sought to establish their
control over Sicily—not an easy task, since it had many
colonies of Greeks whose national spirit and bravery
did not desert them. In this year a call for assistance
from a plundering band who had captured a Greek city,
a part of whom had also invited Carthaginian aid,
brought Rome and Carthage in conflict. The Carthaginians
were enraged at this interference with an island
which they had long intended to make their own, and
raised an immense army to drive out the intruders.
The Romans defeated the army and took Agrigentum,
one of the best strongholds of the Carthaginians on the
island.</p>

<p><span class="date">260—</span>The Carthaginians were masters of the sea, and the
Romans had little knowledge of naval affairs. Taking
a Carthaginian vessel which had been driven ashore for
a model, they, in a short time, created a fleet and
worsted their enemies on their own special element.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">256—</span>The Romans again defeated the Carthaginians in a sea
fight near the island of Lipara.</p>

<p><span class="date">255—</span>The Romans determined to carry the war into Africa,
and fitting out a large fleet, inflicted a still heavier
loss on the Carthaginian armaments, landed in Africa
and defeated an immense army. The Carthaginians
sued for peace, but the terms proposed by Regulus, the
Roman general, were so severe that they resolved to
continue the war. A Grecian general, Xanthippus,
took command of their army and totally defeated the
Romans, taking Regulus prisoner, and destroying or
<span class="date">248—</span>capturing all his army but 2000. The Romans lost
three fleets by storms, but conquered once in a sea
fight, and defeated an army in Sicily. The Carthaginians
again sought peace, but the Romans would not
abate their first terms, and continued the war until the
<span class="date">240—</span>Carthaginians, completely humbled, accepted the severe
alternative of submission or destruction. The temple
of Janus, the god of war, never shut but in time of
absolute peace, was now closed for the second time
since the building of the city.</p>

<p>The people, whose special occupation was war, soon
grew tired of peace, and carried on various conflicts
with the Gauls settled at the foot of the Alps in the
<span class="date">227—</span>north of Italy. They invaded Illyria, on the east coast
of the Adriatic Sea, whose people were very troublesome
pirates. This war was again renewed with a more
complete defeat of the Illyrians. They had before this
subdued Sardinia and Corsica.</p>

<p><span class="date">219—</span>The Carthaginians pursued their conquests in Spain,
and the celebrated Hannibal took Saguntum, which
<span class="date">218—</span>brought on the second Punic war, as the war with Carthage
was termed.</p>

<p><span class="date">217—</span>Hannibal, with great celerity, crossed the Pyrenees and
the Alps—having first completed the conquest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Spain—and defeated the Romans in the battle of Ticinus,
and again at Trebia.</p>

<p><span class="date">217—</span>The Achaian confederacy, now in the height of its glory
in maintaining the liberties of Greece, united all the
Greeks in a confederacy under the influence of Philip,
king of Macedon, with the hope of arresting the power
and ambition of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="date">216—</span>Hannibal inflicted a dreadful defeat on the Romans
near the Thrasymenean Lake. The Romans were
greatly alarmed, and made Fabius Maximus dictator,
whose habit of refusing a pitched battle, wearing out
his adversary by skirmishes and cutting off his supplies,
is called “The Fabian Policy.” This plan is,
by maneuvering and delay, to wear out and destroy
an invader in detail without peril of defeat in battle.
The Romans kept armies in Spain to prevent the Carthaginians
from sending reinforcements to Hannibal.</p>

<p><span class="date">215—</span>At the close of this year Fabius resigned his dictatorship
and the consuls appointed to succeed him abandoned
his policy. They offered battle to Hannibal at
Cannæ and the army was annihilated. 40,000 Romans
were slain on the field. These defeats had destroyed
the flower of their fighting population, but Roman
courage and resolution always rose with defeat. They
did not despair, but raised a fresh army and put Fabius
again at its head, against whom the talents of Hannibal
were vain. They fomented disturbances in Greece to
keep Philip, King of Macedon at home, and besieged
Syracuse in Sicily, which had joined the Carthaginians,
<span class="date">212—</span>for three years, and then took it by stratagem. Archimedes,
a celebrated mathematician of Syracuse, who
had protracted the siege by his ingenious and powerful
engines was killed in the sack of the city. Soon
<span class="date">210—</span>after the whole island was subdued and remained a Roman
province.</p>

<p><span class="date">206—</span>Asdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, general of the Carthaginian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
forces in Spain, crossed the Pyrenees and the
Alps to reinforce Hannibal, but was defeated by the
Romans and slain before Hannibal knew of his march.</p>

<p><span class="date">202—</span>Scipio, who had conquered in Spain, led an army into
Africa, Hannibal being considered too formidable to
attack, though his forces were very small. Scipio put
40,000 Numidians, allies of Carthage, to the sword,
besieged the neighboring cities and defeated a large
Carthaginian army. Hannibal was now called home
to defend the metropolis. He fought a battle with raw
<span class="date">201—</span>troops, at Zama, and was defeated—20,000 Carthaginians
being slain. The Carthaginians begged for peace,
Hannibal declaring that the war could not be protracted.
The Roman terms left them little but their city. Such
was the fruit of inflexible resolution.</p>

</div>

<p>5. The Romans are an example of a people, who, from first
to last, had one clearly defined end, to which everything else
was subservient. They formed their state for conquest, and
that idea controlled the Kingdom, the Republic and the Empire.
They were much wiser than the Spartans, for, devoting
themselves to war, they meant to secure and enjoy all the fruits
of conquest, and they did all that was possible to promote the
prosperity of their people that they might produce warriors
in abundance; but they relied mainly on actual war for discipline.
They were constantly exercised in the art in the field
and the orderly and sensible instinct of the race made discipline
a matter of course. They were sometimes defeated when
they encountered unfamiliar difficulties, or by the mistakes of
their leaders, but never abandoned a purpose once adopted and
never sued for peace.</p>

<p>Morally, the object they set before them was entirely unjustifiable,
according to the standard of national rights accepted
in our day. But such a conception never entered the minds
of men in the ancient times. It is the fruit of modern civilization
alone. The Romans, and many a nation after them,
must work out the destructive consequences of that doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that “Might makes Right” before the universal sense of
mankind would recoil from it. It was the accepted doctrine
of the ancients, and has not yet disappeared from the world.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">197—</span>Sicily, Spain and Carthage were conquered, and Roman
valor looked around for opportunities of winning fresh
laurels. Philip of Macedon, an ambitious prince, threatened
the Athenians, who implored help from Rome.
An army immediately proceeded to Greece, penetrated
into Macedonia, and completely defeated Philip at Cynocephalæ.</p>

</div>

<p>6. The Romans were now the mightiest people in the civilized
world. Their obstinate contests with the vigorous nations
of the West had often perilled the existence of their state,
and a people of ordinary stamina and persistence would not,
at the best, have risen above the rank of the Etruscans and
Samnites, nor have made Rome greater than Syracuse or Carthage.
They, however, matured and grew into an invincible
power, whose solid and stately grandeur struck the intelligent
but unpractical Greeks with admiration, and all the old peoples
of the East with awe.</p>

<p>The Romans were not without admiration for the ancient
valor and the graceful culture of the Greeks. When, two hundred
and fifty years before, the Romans revised their laws, under
the Decemvirate, they sent to Athens to obtain models
from that republic. Athens was now treated by them with
much consideration, and finally became the University City
of the Empire. When Roman influence became paramount
after the battle of Cynocephalæ they did not at once proceed
with brutal force against the land of Beauty and Art, but took
it under their protection, and proclaimed the full liberty of
the Grecian States. It filled the Greeks with transport, and
for some time Rome played the noble and dignified part of a
disinterested protector; but when the Achaians, under their
excellent and talented leader Philopœmen, sought to realize
the fact of liberty, the Romans abandoned that pretence and
made Greece a Roman province. Thus the whole of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that was sufficiently civilized to maintain a settled government
was ruled by the Roman Republic. The period of rude and
restless valor among the Greeks was past. The stage of cultivation
they had reached inclined them to the quiet and elegant
refinements of the scholar, and they readily received the Roman
rule which suppressed the turbulence of ambitious adventurers
and suffered no oppression but their own. The Romans
represented the strength of the male element in human nature,
the Greeks the grace of the female. They now coalesced, were
married, so to speak, and the product of their union was, in
the course of ages, modern civilization, which, when mature,
was to share the eminent qualities of both.</p>

<p>7. The broken fragments of Alexander’s immense empire
in Western Asia and Egypt were all that now stood between
Rome and the mastery of the world. The Roman people
were too well convinced that it was their grand destiny to
achieve universal dominion to hasten prematurely the conquest
of the primitive home of civilization. They watchfully
waited until the course of events should throw the dominions
of the Seleucidæ and the Ptolemys into their hands, without
offending the majesty of the republic by an undignified violence
and haste.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">190—</span>Antiochus the Great, who now reigned over the empire
of the Seleucidæ, with true Grecian imprudence, became
ambitious of conquests in Europe. He invaded Greece
<span class="date">191—</span>and was defeated at Thermopylæ by the Romans and
driven into Asia. The younger Scipio, brother of the
conqueror of Hannibal, followed and totally defeated
<span class="date">189—</span>him at Magnesia, in Asia Minor. He purchased peace
by the loss of all the fruits of his ambition, but was
left in possession of the Syrian kingdom. The failure
to destroy so powerful an enemy appears to have
brought on the two Scipios the rebuke of the republic,
the conqueror of Carthage having aided his brother
in the war. They were condemned to a heavy fine,
which Scipio Africanus refused to pay and went int<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>o
<span class="date">183—</span>exile, where he died. His death occurred in the same
year that Hannibal, pursued by the vengeance of the
Romans for having aided Antiochus, committed suicide
by taking poison to avoid falling into their hands; and
in this year also Philopœmen, the last patriotic hero
<span class="date">170—</span>of Greece, was slain by his enemies. Perses, king of
Macedon, revolted, and, after some successes, was finally
overthrown under the walls of Pydna and dethroned.</p>

<p><span class="date">168—</span>The Carthaginians could not altogether forget their
ancient greatness, and having displeased the Romans
by some independence of action, it was resolved to
<span class="date">148—</span>destroy their city. With the courage of despair they
set the Romans at defiance, and defended themselves
with a resolute bravery that engaged the lively sympathies
of all after times for their painful fate. For two
years they maintained the combat against their pitiless
foes, who could pardon everything but rivalry in their
<span class="date">146—</span>sweeping ambition, and then perished in the ruins of
their once glorious metropolis. A revolt of the Achaians
was punished, in the same year, by the destruction
of the splendid city of Corinth, in Greece.</p>

<p><span class="date">140—</span>The embers of independence in Spain broke forth
in war, which was checked by the assassination of
Viriathes, a patriotic chieftain of great ability, and
<span class="date">133—</span>quenched in blood by the self-destruction of the citizens
of Numantium. About the same time the
republic acquired the kingdom of Pergamus, covering
the richest parts of Asia Minor, by the will of
Attalus, its king, who, on his death, bequeathed it to
Rome. This led, in a few years, to contests with the
neighboring Asiatic sovereigns, and resulted, in about
half a century, in the conquest and reduction into the
state of Roman provinces of all Western Asia.</p>

<span class="smaller">DECAY OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.</span></h4>

<p>1. But while Rome was thus steadily advancing to universal
dominion, great and unfortunate changes were taking
place in its internal constitution. The spoils of Carthage
and the east, rich in accumulations of the industry, commerce
and art of two thousand years, flowed into Rome and was
gathered into the hands of those in power; the equilibrium
between the plebeans and the patricians was lost; the selling
of captives taken in war filled Italy with slaves; and the
inequality of conditions produced the most disastrous consequences.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">133—</span>The eldest son of a noble house, the Gracchi, undertook
to stem the torrent that was sweeping away the
ancient barriers of the constitution, and to raise the
people from the misery into which the increase of
patrician wealth and power and the innumerable multitudes
of slaves had plunged them. In the year in
which Numantia fell and Spain was thoroughly subdued,
Tiberius Gracchus was slain in a tumult, produced
by the patricians, who determined that his
project should not succeed. He had attempted to
revive the old agrarian law, by which the landed possessions
of the republic were shared among the people
as well as the patricians, which would have rescued the
plebeans from poverty and oppression; but the patricians
were too powerful and too violent. He was
removed by assassination.</p>

</div>

<p>2.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">121—</span>Twelve years later his brother, Caius Gracchus,
attempted the same thing and was likewise slain.
This point was vital to the internal liberties of Rome.
The failure of the Gracchi announced the overthrow
of the constitution; and, after seventy years of civil
anarchy and the murderous conflict of rival factions,
the empire was found the only refuge against the ruin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of the state. Vigorous Rome, who could govern all
the world but herself, must have a master, and became
the prey of the strongest. It is a melancholy history,
a sad conclusion for a people whose strength and grandeur
of character had made them masters of the world,
but a perfectly legitimate result of the immoral principle
that lay at the foundation of the state. That
principle legalized the doctrine of force, or robbery on
the grandest scale. They carried it out with great consistency
and skill, with all the ability of a race eminently
sagacious and steady in the pursuit of an end.
The conservative force that dwelt in their organization,
so instinctively and exceptionally wise, and the
power of religious faith, strong in a hardy and simple
people, however weakened by pagan ignorance and
superstition, long maintained the integrity of their
institutions—but Greek culture, too imperfect not to
culminate in skepticism, came in to confuse their moral
sense at the same time that boundless wealth flowed
into their hands to corrupt their manners, that slavery
assumed gigantic proportions to demoralize labor, and
the conquest of the world relieved them from the
severe discipline that might not, otherwise, have left
them the leisure to become deeply vicious.</p>

<p>The sternness of even Roman character was unequal
to the heavy strain and virtue gave way. The native
vigor of the race made them as excessive in unrestrained
passion as wise in council and invincible in war. The
cruelty and rapacity that were common in the civil wars
of the Republic, and under many of the early emperors,
educated giants in crime, and only the Roman spirit in
the army, and the vigorous organization everywhere
maintained through the institutions established in the
subject world by Roman law, could have held its vast
dominions together. Rome had vitality and sense to
govern others, even in the midst of civil war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>3. From the death of the Gracchi to the consulship
<span class="date">107—</span>Of Marius, Rome was in a tumult of corrupt intrigue,
which rendered easy the usurpation and inhuman
cruelty of Jugurtha, king of Numidia. Marius, a plebian
of the lowest rank, became consul. He was
unequaled at once as a general and a tyrant. He conquered
<span class="date">106—</span>Jugurtha, who was brought to Rome and starved in
prison. In the same year Cicero, the great Roman
orator, was born.</p>

<p>A vast horde of Cimbri and Teutons from northern
<span class="date">105—</span>Europe, invaded Gaul and defeated several Roman consuls.</p>

<p><span class="date">100—</span>Marius led an army against these barbarians and
defeated them, more than 100,000 being slain or
made prisoners. He was equally successful in a second
engagement. During the war 200,000 barbarians were
slain and 90,000 taken prisoners. A revolt of the
slaves was put down about the same time with circumstances
of extreme cruelty. More than a million of
these unfortunates were slain or thrown to wild beasts
for the amusement of the Roman populace.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">100—</span>In this year Julius Cæsar, one of the greatest men

was born. His supreme ability put an end to civil dissention
and saved society from total ruin.</p>

<p><span class="date">90—</span>The Italian allies revolted against Rome. They claimed
the privileges of Roman citizenship, which the Senate
refused. A war of three years followed and half a
million of men perished, when, having conquered
them, the Senate granted their first request.</p>

<p><span class="date">88—</span>Mithridates, king of Pontus, talented and ambitious,
sought to drive the Romans out of Asia and Greece,
and warred with them for twenty-five years. Sylla
procured the banishment of his rival, Marius, and conducted
the war against Mithridates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">86—</span>Marius regained power in the absence of Sylla and
slaughtered his enemies, the patricians, without mercy,
but soon after died.</p>

<p><span class="date">83—</span>Sylla, after obliging Mithridates to sue for peace,
hastened to Rome, conquered his enemies, and slew
more than 6,000 Roman citizens in revenge.</p>

<p><span class="date">81—</span>Sylla caused himself to be made perpetual dictator</p>

<p><span class="date">77—</span>But after three years resigned and soon after died from
the effects of his vices. Civil war was continued for a
time in Spain and Italy, but finally put down by Pompey,
<span class="date">70—</span>the greatest general of the patrician party.</p>

<p>The war of the gladiators—men trained to fight in
the theatres for the amusement of the populace—broke
out under an able leader, Spartacus, who, collecting an
army of 120,000 gladiators, endangered Rome itself, but
<span class="date">70—</span>he was conquered by Crassus. Spartacus was defeated
and killed. It was the inhuman oppression of the
patricians that produced all these dreadful conflicts.</p>

<p><span class="date">65—</span>Pompey and Crassus, by paying court to the people,
were made consuls. Pompey proceeded to Asia and
made war on Mithridates, who was again formidable,
<span class="date">63—</span>whom he defeated and slew in battle. He subdued
nearly all western Asia, visiting Jerusalem, and treating
the Jews with kindness. He also cleared the Mediterranean
of pirates, who had always infested it.</p>

<p><span class="date">62—</span>A dangerous conspiracy of Cataline, a patrician of the
most corrupt morals, at the head of the depraved young
nobility of the time, would have been successful but
for the ability and eloquence of Cicero, who was consul.
Cataline and his fellow conspirators were taken and
slain.</p>

<p><span class="date">59—</span>Cæsar, Pompey, and Crassus formed the first “Triumvirate,”
and divided the rule of the world between
them. Cæsar was the head of the popular party. He
<span class="date">57—</span>took Gaul as his government. Here he spent eight
years in his “Gallic wars,” showing unparalleled talents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

battle, and completely subduing the fierce Gauls. He
<span class="date">55—</span>entered Britain and laid the foundation of civilization
there, thus carrying the march of empire to its
farthest bounds in Europe.</p>

</div>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">49—</span>He was ordered to return and lay down his authority
by the Roman Senate, headed by Pompey, who was
now his enemy. They were the rival champions of the
two parties in the state, the people and the patricians,
whose quarrels had so long filled Rome with tumult
and slaughter. The tribunes in Cæsar’s interest interposed
a veto, which the Roman Constitution authorized
them to do. The Senate voted to suspend the Constitution,
which really terminated the Roman Republic,
Jan. 7, B. C. 49. Cæsar at once crossed the river Rubicon,
the boundary of his government, and marched
his army on Rome. Pompey and the aristocratic party
fled in haste, leaving the public treasure behind. In
sixty days Cæsar had possession of all Italy. Sicily,
Sardinia, and Spain were next conquered from the officers
of Pompey, when he returned to Rome, and was
created dictator by his party. He treated all his enemies
with clemency. Pompey had gone into Greece,
<span class="date">48—</span>where he gathered a large army. Cæsar followed with
his veteran legions, and defeated him in the battle of
Pharsalia in Thessaly. Pompey fled to Egypt, where
he was treacherously slain, to the great indignation of
Cæsar, who would shed no blood but in necessary battle.
Thus he became sole master of the world.</p>

<p>In a conflict with the Egyptians in Alexandria Cæsar
set on fire their fleet, he being attended by but few
troops, and the conflagration extended to the Alexandrian
Library, filled with inestimable treasures of
ancient literature, which were destroyed, to the great
loss of future generations. Cæsar soon subdued Egypt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>

Cæsar, committed suicide rather than submit to him.
In Spain he soon after defeated the sons of Pompey,
the last of his foes in arms. He rebuilt Carthage and
<span class="date">45—</span>Corinth. He projected many great public works and
useful reforms. The whole power of Roman sovereignty
<span class="date">44—</span>was formally conferred on him by the people, when
he was suddenly assassinated by a band of senators and
certain conspirators, who imagined it possible to restore
the ancient Republic. His nephew, Augustus, succeeded
him soon after.</p>

<p><span class="date">43—</span>The eminent Cicero, never a friend to Cæsar, was assassinated

acquired possession of all the powers of the state, ruthlessly
murdered thousands of their political enemies.
They soon grew jealous of each other, and fought and

<h4 id="SECTION_IX">SECTION IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ROMAN EMPIRE.</span></h4>

<p>1. B. C. 28—In this year Augustus, having fully consolidated
his power, was formally recognized emperor. During all the
contests of factions, and when Rome was itself in the throes of
revolution, the subjection of all the provinces to the imperial
city, and whoever was in power there, was rigorously maintained.
The inhabitants were protected from invasion, and if
they were often oppressed by Roman governors, it was far less
than under their native rulers, and, in general, they were not
desirous of a change. Roman law and order, and the power
of appeal from great injustice to the Roman senate or emperor,
maintained a state of generally tranquil prosperity, only disturbed
by the contests of rivals for the control of the imperial
city and its power.</p>

<p>A long period of almost absolute quiet followed the establishment
of the empire, which gave Rome and Italy great
satisfaction, after nearly a hundred years of civil war. It is
called the “Augustan Age,” when industry and commerce,
literature and the arts, reached their highest development.</p>

<p>The Roman Empire and the Christian era commenced nearly
together. During the thirty years that followed the battle of
Actium, which secured to Augustus the sole control of the
civilized world, by the defeat of his last rival, Antony, he was
occupied in organizing the vast machinery of his government,
and centralizing all the parts of the administration in his own
person. For near three hundred years Western Asia and
Greece had been a scene of violent commotion. Rival adventurers
were constantly seeking to reconstruct the empire of
Alexander. Some of these had the genius and the good fortune
to succeed, in part at least, and swayed a powerful scepter
over a large region during their own lives, and, in some
instances, their dominions were held together for several generations.
But there was no sufficient base for a strong and
permanent government. There was no stable element on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which to rest it. The Greeks were brave, intelligent and
enterprising, and no Asiatic people could withstand a Greek
army under Greek leaders; but the Greeks were too restless,
too easily carried away by enthusiasm for a new leader or a
new idea to be capable of upholding an empire.</p>

<p>2. Thus, Asia and Greece had been a vast battle field, and
the battles served no general interest and founded no permanent
state. The Greeks grew tired of supporting the claims of each
new aspirant, who returned their favor by depriving them
of liberty, and the whole eastern world readily submitted to
the Romans, under whom there was, at least, a prospect of
civil order. Augustus, then, had little trouble in settling the
affairs of the whole empire, and, about thirty years after the
battle of Actium, finding the entire world quietly content and
the administration everywhere in fair working order, directed
the gates of the temple of Janus to be closed, and a census to
be made of all his subjects. At this time Jesus Christ was
born and the Christian era commenced.</p>

<p>The Roman Empire under Augustus was the culmination of
the ancient and pagan civilization. It had great vitality, and
strength enough to rule the world four hundred years longer;
but it had also fatal weaknesses. We have seen that the existence
of the empire originated in the inability of the old society
to free itself from the vices which long and great prosperity
had developed. It had no purifying element strong enough
to drive out the disease which its moral weakness had allowed
to fasten on it. It was, in fact, based on wrong and could not
but perish. Its fall was only a question of time. Its ferocious
valor and contempt of the rights of nations broke down the
very virtue that was essential to the stability of society. The
Romans were robbers on a grand scale, and it was very natural
that, when there were no more foreign nations to slay and
plunder, the citizens should fall to cutting each others throats
and robbing their neighbors. As this would lead to the immediate
ruin of society and the state, the empire, which gave
them an absolute master, was a necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>3. But a full comprehension of the moral laws on which
society, institutions and states are founded, was the last to be
gained. Most modern nations have not yet attained it, notwithstanding
that Christianity has so long stated the principles
with clearness and force.</p>

<p>The common mind of humanity could master them only by
growth through thousands of years and innumerable experiences.
The object of all earthly experience is to develop the
value of the <i>individual man</i>; and the object of society, of
institutions and of government, is to protect the rights and to
favor the development of <i>each man</i> of the race. When this
end is fully secured, history will have solved its problem. As
the commencement of the Christian era was the turning point
of history in some most important respects, it is proper to
glance back and forward over the state of this problem, and the
relation of Christianity to it, before proceeding with the general
course of events.</p>

<p>At first men were like children, with everything to learn;
and, like children, they learned one thing at a time; and they
also made an addition to their common stock of knowledge at
every remove of the centre of growth. In Asia and Egypt the
general lesson was industry and obedience, while the Jews, on
the western shore, more or less assisted by the Assyrians, the
Egyptians and the Greeks, labored at the development of a
pure religion which culminated in Christianity. The removal
of the centre to Greece added mental and artistic culture, and
the further westward journey to Rome gave them a new class
of most important ideas concerning public organization, law
and order.</p>

<p>4. If each of these lessons had been perfect in themselves
the addition made by Christianity, which defined the relations
between men, the law of human rights and the doctrines essential
to the stability and purity of society, would have enabled
mankind to build up satisfactory institutions and a complete
civilization from the Roman period. But the elementary lessons
were very incomplete. The Asiatics became very superstitious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the Greeks could teach men the <i>art</i> of thinking, or
exercising their minds, but they could not find the true starting
point; they did not discover what subjects it was useful,
and what it was useless, to reason upon; and wasted a good
part of the thought of their times on profitless questions.
Their failure to obtain a clear and valuable result from philosophy
made men skeptical and contributed much to the decline
of civilization in the time of the Roman empire. The Romans
built their whole structure of law and order on <i>force</i> and a
wholesale violation of the rights of mankind, and the minds
of men became greatly confused. The doctrine of the Epicurean
philosophers—“Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we
die”—a despair of working out the problem of life to a satisfactory
answer, became the most popular in the empire. The
splendor and glory of Oriental, Grecian and Roman civilization
seemed to end in degrading servility and superstition, in
the endless and absurd speculations of so-called philosophers,
and in the vast brutal tyranny of the emperors. The east
failed of a pure religion that was generally accepted. Greek
philosophy did not have science to guide her thought, and
Rome could not be just as well as strong.</p>

<p>5. It was only in modern times that these lessons were
made complete. The discoveries in Geography, in Astronomy,
in Natural Philosophy, in Chemistry, in Geology, made men
acquainted with the structure of the universe, the properties
and the laws of matter, and corrected the extravagances of the
ancient speculative philosophy. For want of science, Greek
thought wandered about in an unreal world and lost a good
part of its labor. A long experience under the control of this,
corrected thought was required to construct a science of Government
that should supply what was wanting to Roman
jurisprudence, and Christianity itself could not be rightly
understood while so many false theories and wrong practices
prevailed.</p>

<p>But the ancient times were as essential to the building up
of the modern as the modern to the completion of the ancient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
It was the renewed study of the Greek classics, of Roman law,
and of the original teachings of Christianity, under more
favorable circumstances, and after many new experiences for a
thousand years, that gave birth to all our later improvements
in religion, in government and in science. The Asiatic Jews
gave us in Christianity, a pure and simple worship, and a
system of public morality so perfect that no society has yet
been able to embody it completely in practice, although it is
now recognized, very generally, as the highest conceivable
standard, to be constantly aimed at and conformed to as far as
possible; the Greek Philosopher, Aristotle, gave us the first
notions of science, and Roman law formed the base of modern
legal practice.</p>

<p>6. The difficulties of progress are very great. It is not
easier for nations to unlearn what they have learned amiss in
their youth, than for individuals. No nation that has matured
institutions has ever yet thoroughly reformed them. The best
and most clear sighted minds discover their defects and show
what is to be remedied; but the force of habit and the veneration
men feel for what is old, offer so much resistance to complete
reforms that it has been necessary to establish and build
up institutions on new principles on fresh ground. So all the
light and power of science, of the reformed religion, of a
more complete system of law, the greater intelligence of the
masses of men and the activity of commerce and trade did not
suffice to do for modern Europe what has been done with ease
in America. But Europe furnished the ideas which America
worked out; and the sight of those principles embodied in
institutions that greatly improved the condition of mankind
has reacted on Europe, and bids fair, in time, to produce a
novelty in human experience—a complete regeneration of old
nations and governments. When Greece rose to power it
subjected but lightly, and only superficially transformed, the
nations of Asia; Rome absorbed them both, and Christianity
gave its simple and noble lessons to them all. But the slight
influence of Greece, Rome and Christianity on the old nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of western Asia is shown in the rise and permanence of
Mohammedanism, so inferior, in all respects, to Christianity.
After a career of more than twelve hundred years, it still rules
many more millions than were contained in all the Roman
Empire in its most prosperous days.</p>

<p>7. But the power of a progressive civilization constantly
increases, and will, by and by, be equal to the thorough reform
of even crystalized China. Without America, Europe would
be still struggling with the incipient stages of reform. With
it, she has gone far toward correcting the imperfections which
existed one hundred years ago, and will presently complete the
process. With these general observations, we proceed to
examine the influence of Christianity on the old civilization.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_X">SECTION X.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY.</span></h4>

<p>1. It was developed on the western borders of Asia, and
was the completion or perfect development of the system of
religion existing among the Jews from a very early period.
Soon after Abraham, the father and grand patriarch of the
Jews, had given his descendants the outlines of the system,
they were led, by circumstances, to Egypt, and remained there
for many generations. When they left Egypt, it was under
the leadership of one of the greatest of the world’s great men,
who had been heir apparent of the Egyptian throne, and was
consequently versed in all the mysterious wisdom of the priesthood
of that country. That he became wiser than they is
evident from the history of his contest with them before the
king when endeavoring to gain his consent to the migration
of his people from the country. Instructed in all the celebrated
“wisdom of the Egyptians,” together with the reflections
and additions of forty solitary years as a shepherd in
Arabia, he produced a remarkable system of mingled theology
and legislation which has come down as a sacred record to our
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The Jews were, nine hundred years afterwards, transported
as a nation to Babylon, remained there for more than
two generations, and received such light as the Babylonian
priests and Persian magi were able to give them. The conquest
of Asia by the Greeks and the vicinity of Judea to commercial
Tyre, furnished them all the aid these nations could
give in the line of religious suggestion. A Jew produced, in
the early days of the Roman Empire, the simple, yet sublime
teachings of Christianity. It had the comprehensiveness and
directness requisite to give it authority as a universal religion.
In few, but plain and convincing words, it laid down the principles
of human rights and of divine law. It defined the
nature and stated the sanctions of virtue in the clearest terms;
tore away every covering from vice and denounced without
fear the favorite ambitions and follies of men. It seems
almost incredible that such a system should have had its
origin even among a people like the Jews, and at the time
when the Roman Empire represented the highest civilization
of the world.</p>

<p>3. The Jews, as a nation, however, rejected and bitterly
persecuted it, and the Romans, who were, on principle, extremely
tolerant of all foreign religions, soon became extremely
hostile. It was humble, unostentatious, very simple in all its
forms, carefully refrained from all interference with established
government, and presented many new and consoling truths,
with great force. It would have seemed that it had only to
speak to gain a hearing and take a leading place at once in the
work of the future. The few unprejudiced among the great,
and thousands of the poor and oppressed whom the cruel
power of the Romans had deprived of nationality, property
and personal liberty, and many whose minds recoiled from
the vices, crimes and skepticism of the age, heard and embraced
it with joy. But it rebuked with most severity the
ambitions, the injustice and the love of luxury that were most
prevalent in that age and that were most distinctly Roman.
It was peculiarly severe against all other systems of religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and that formed the strongest barrier against its immediate
spread over the pagan world at large. It was, therefore, persecuted
with the greatest rigor for three hundred years.</p>

<p>4. But persecution called public attention to it and won it
sympathy, and it continually spread beneath the surface of society.
The brutal features of Roman character were gradually
softened; very gradually, indeed, for Roman manners and
morals were an Augean stable which it was a more than herculean
task to cleanse; but after a time, the gigantic crimes
of a Marius, a Sylla, a Nero, or Domitian became impossible,
and the horrors of the theatre, where gladiators killed each
other and men were thrown to wild beasts for the amusement
of the populace, became rare. Atrocious crimes awakened a
disgust that showed a different view and a new standard of
judgment in the community. Christianity created a purer
moral atmosphere even in Rome, and while it was persecuted
with the utmost barbarity.</p>

<p>5. It is then no matter of surprise that Christianity did
not at once meet with general acceptance, and did not fully
reconstruct Roman society and manners. The marvel is that
it could be produced at all by an age to whose whole spirit it
was so absolutely contrary. It was the doctrine of peace proclaimed
among nations who knew no occupation so glorious as
war; whose institutions all rested on conquest; whose dominant
race—admired as much as feared—was the very genius
and embodiment of martial force arrayed against the independence
of all nationalities by an organization the most complete.
It proclaimed the <i>rights</i> of <i>man</i> and the equality of
all classes and persons before the Divine Law, to a people who
had plunged in a common ruin Carthage and Corinth, the
Republics of Greece, and the absolute rulers of monarchical
Asia. It scorned equally gorgeous ceremonies of worship,
the subtleties of an imperfect philosophy and pride of place
and power.</p>

<p>It is not possible to imagine a greater contrast to all the
modes of habit and thought prevalent in those times. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
most sensual of all races it exhorted to spirituality, to the most
cruel and insolent it preached meekness and forbearance. It
placed the slave to whom the recognized laws of war left no
rights, beside the master who gloried in setting his foot on the
neck of the prostrate; and recognized as equals the great and
the small, the ignorant and the wise, the bond and the free.</p>

<p>We cannot be surprised that it did not obtain immediate
currency, that it was everywhere scorned and cast out, that it
aroused unheard of persecutions, and that it could only obtain,
a triumph when the old Roman inflexibility and fierceness had
died out of its degenerate children, and the spirit of the ancient
world was burned out in the hot fires of its own passions.
Character does not change in a day, and the ruling impulses
of a race can be modified only by slow degrees. Such is the
supreme law which has ruled all history.</p>

<p>6. From all these causes Christianity was slow in penetrating
society and moulding institutions; but it spread so
extensively that a clear sighted emperor at length found it
politic to profess Christianity in order to gain the support of
so large and vigorous an element against his rivals in power.
Constantine was victorious and proceeded to make Christianity
the state religion. It had maintained its growth by its real
superiority and ever after remained the most powerful and
productive among the influences that aided the progress of
mankind. It was actively aggressive and had made the barbarians
who overthrew Rome converts to the faith before the invasion,
and thus broke the force and diminished the disastrous
effects of that event. In after times, no sooner did a barbarian
tribe appear and establish itself in any part of the old empire
than Christianity commenced the work of teaching and proselyting,
which aided much in restoring order and repairing ruin.
Had Christianity preserved its purity its usefulness and power
would have been much greater.</p>

<p>7. But as it gained in numbers and in position it lost internal
strength. Both Oriental and Greek philosophy tainted its
simple doctrines and introduced in various forms the hurtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
speculations so dear to the ancients; and when it became the
court religion the simplicity of its ceremonies was gradually
replaced by the pomp and splendor of pagan worship. Constantine
and his successors in the empire assumed the virtual
headship of the church, called councils and packed them for
political purposes, and pronounced for or against supposed
heresies. The offices of the church became the rewards of
ambition and gradually a hierarchy, or regular gradation, was
established in the priesthood, and both faith and manners came
to be strangely in contrast with their original simplicity. Yet,
Christianity, aping the forms and infected with the superstitions
of paganism, and become the tool of the aspiring, was
still alive with a youthful vigor by which she eased the fall of
the old civilization, and was abundant in valuable service for
the civilization yet to be.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_XI">SECTION XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SERVICES OF GREAT MEN TO MANKIND.</span></h4>

<p>1. It is difficult for us to comprehend the embarrassments
which a want of diffused information presented to the progress of
the ancient days. With no books, or, at best, but very few, with
little or no record of the past, or the distant present, but what
confused, distorted and uncertain tradition and rumor could
give, with almost no <i>instruments</i> of thought and education, it
would seem natural that they should fall into a hopeless barbarism.
That they raised themselves so far out of a condition
so low and so helpless, that they created so many instruments for
<i>us</i>, is a proof of the wonderful capacity for advancement that
lies in humanity, and a prophecy of stupendous things yet in
store for mankind.</p>

<p>2. One of the most important elements of their progress
lay in their <i>great men</i>. It is indispensable that a man, to
become great, or famous, by exercising a wide influence, should
represent in a large, well defined and successful way, the general
tendency and aspiration of his times. He must unite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
clear perception of these tendencies in his mind, with the
power to give them adequate expression in his words or deeds.
He must be so far ahead of his times as to be able to clearly
work out what is lying unexpressed in the general mind, but
not so far ahead that it cannot come into sympathy and
co-operation with him; else he will not be recognized as great.
Great men are a summary of their times, or of the people they
dwell among; they gather its tendencies to a point and express
the undefined desire of that period. Their value for later
times is that they represent the spirit of their race at that time
in a form to make a striking impression, and those who have
the good fortune to represent the qualities of the best races, or
of nations at the most important stage of their history, become
the general exemplars of mankind; teaching in a forcible and
striking way the lessons which have been wrought out in the
experience of a whole people for ages.</p>

<p>3. The poets are the first of these great men of whom history
gives us any account, except, perhaps, the heroes whose
deeds they sung, which are more or less uncertain, because
they clothed the common tradition of their times in an imaginative
and fictitious dress. The poets Homer and Hesiod had
great influence on early Greece. They summed up its theology
and the history of its admired heroes, and gave expression to
the early thought and literary turn of that people.</p>

<p>Their legislators came next. They gave expression to the
genius of their people in institutions and laws. Lycurgus
arranged the Spartan state into a military school. His laws
remained in force more than five hundred years. Solon was
the legislator of Athens and his laws were much admired for
their wisdom and justice. The Greeks could think more
wisely than they could act. Lycurgus organized the warlike
spirit in Greece as well as Sparta. The small Grecian states,
determined to keep Sparta and each one of the other states
from destroying their individual liberties, were trained by the
necessity of combating the vigorous military organization of
Sparta to great ability in war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Under Pericles, a republican statesman of Athens, nearly a
century later than Solon, the full glory of the Grecian genius
shone forth. He encouraged his countrymen to give the support
to art and literature that produced the famous master
pieces which have made Greece illustrious and influential to
this day.</p>

<p>4. Socrates appeared soon after. He was the apostle of
thought. His influence in leading men to use direct and
effective modes of examination and reasoning was incalculable,
and has perhaps had more effect on the world than the
victorious career of Alexander or of the Romans. He was
followed by Plato, a disciple of his, who pushed out to further
results the same principles. He is called the prince of philosophers,
and has exerted a world-wide influence. He had not
the simplicity and plain directness of Socrates, though his
mind was more polished, and he was more learned. Some
scholars, however, consider his masterpieces to indicate as
powerful a mind as the world has produced. He spent
twelve years in travel, and used all the means of education,
and study then to be found. His works are still the delight
of the most accomplished scholars.</p>

<p>5. Aristotle began his career in the last years of Plato.
He was the tutor of Alexander the Great. He followed a different
line of study, wrote on logic, or the art of reasoning,
on the natural sciences, and introduced method in the exercise
of the mind and in study. Herodotus, Xenophon, Thucydides,
and many other great writers, artists and sculptors, lived
about the same period; and thus Grecians did for the mind
what the Romans did for law and government—laid down
the fundamental principles which formed the basis of real
progress.</p>

<p>The free government of Athens encouraged oratory and the
art of persuasion. Demosthenes was the most celebrated
orator among the Greeks, and if his state had only been more
powerful he would have conquered Philip of Macedon. He
was indeed one of the greatest orators of all times. Cicero,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
among the Romans, was a writer and orator of almost equal
merit. They both lived just at the downfall of the liberties
of their states, and they spoke with more effect to the times
after them than to their contemporaries. If they did not
succeed in preserving the liberties of Greece and Rome, they
made a great impression, the name of Liberty was consecrated
by their noble words, and those who destroyed it made infamous
by their burning invectives. When a more favorable
time came for restoring it, they lived again in influence, and
triumphed by the memory and record of their great patriotism
and powerful eloquence.</p>

<p>6. Great conquerors and warriors, in all times, have also
been representative men, giving expression and gratification
to the warlike spirit of their people, and producing great
changes that have been favorable to the real advancement of
mankind. The energies they stirred up, and the mingling of
nations they produced generally promoted civilization. Alexander
the Great displayed the wonderful genius and fertility in
resources that was peculiarly Greek. His nation was almost
consoled for the loss of their liberties by the conquests to which
he led them. He opened to their study unknown regions, and
gave their mental genius a broader play and a fuller occupation.
They, to such an extent as change was possible with old civilizations,
<i>Hellenized</i> the East and prepared the way for the
reception of Christianity. Alexander, in three great battles,
conquered the great Persian Empire with a small army. He
never suffered defeat, and died at thirty-three years of age.
Had he lived, he might have done what Hannibal could not
do—have crushed the rising power of the Roman republic.
It would have been a misfortune, for the Romans did incalculable
service to humanity. Greek learning exerted its influence
on the East for two hundred and fifty years before its
final conquest by the Romans. Alexander did great service
to mankind by his military success. Hannibal is an instance
of a great man not as fully representative of his own people,
perhaps, and whose misfortune it was to have to struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
against a people whose united genius was greater, more
inventive, and more patient than his own. The Roman
Pompey represented the aristocratic element of his people,
and though a great general, hardly deserved to succeed.
Julius Cæsar possessed the merciful character and intelligence
of the Greek and the prodigious energy and resolution of the
Roman. His conquest of Gaul and Britain introduced civilization
into the lands that were, five hundred years later, to
begin a new career for mankind. His thorough subjection of
the Gauls preserved the ancient civilization from the inroads
of the vigorous Germans until all was ready for the new order
of things. More than any other great man, he may be said
to have been representative of the best spirit of his time.
Perceiving that the Roman republic was dead, and could not
possibly be restored, from the strength of the vices ruling in
the state, he repressed its anarchy and set aside its forms,
wisely and prudently, with as little bloodshed or cruelty us
possible. He thoroughly represented the practical sense and
immense vigor of the true Roman. He has been severely
reproached for destroying the republic, but the republic virtually
fell with the Gracchi, seventy-five years before, and he
established the only government that could possibly preserve
the Roman state from disorganization.</p>

<p>7. The office of all these, and multitudes of other great
men, less representative of the greater qualities of their fellows,
or representative of less striking features of their times,
has been to sum up the character of their people, and present
their special features, <i>condensed</i>, for the observation of mankind,
and by their position as leaders, to give their times an
opportunity for powerful development, as well as to show
what mankind are capable of. In this last view they stimulate
individuals to aspiration and effort. Millions of men,
probably, have had the qualities of Alexander and Cæsar,
millions more those of Demosthenes and Cicero, of Socrates,
Plato and Aristotle, and so of all the different classes of great
men, but have wanted the opportunities and peculiar stimulants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to develop them. Whoever can appreciate them, can,
with a favorable balance of faculties to give equally sound
judgment, together with equally favorable circumstances,
imitate them. Modern times have shown multitudes of men
who, their character and talents taken as a whole, have shown
themselves far greater than any of the ancients. Culture and
the mingling of races will, perhaps, finally make <i>all</i> men
greater than the greatest of the ancients.</p>

<p>8. Brutus, one of the murderers of Cæsar, wished to
restore the glories of the ancient Roman republic, and thought
Cæsar stood in the way. He removed him by violence, and
found the difficulties greater than ever. A hundred years of
conquest had sapped the virtues of the Roman people, and
Brutus killed himself in despair, saying: “O Virtue! thou art
but a name!” To Cæsar succeeded Augustus, by a necessity
of things. Without Cæsar’s clemency, he deluged Rome with
the blood of its citizens. Afterward, however, his rule was
less sanguinary, and for thirty years he ruled with mildness,
though with despotism. The limited amount of virtue in
pagan civilizations wore out; and notwithstanding the intelligence
of Greece and the good sense of Rome, the ancient
world was obliged to close its career as it began, by absolute
monarchy. It remained for the modern world to find, among
its more abundant resources, the means of forever preserving
itself from decline. Education and purity, science and religion,
freedom and fraternity among all races and nations; a
knowledge and wisdom not conceived by the ancients, a replacing
of war and violence, which are essentially demoralizing,
by peaceful means, which shall benefit all and injure none;
perfectly free intercourse under the guidance of absolute justice
and benevolence; such is the way by which the modern
world will work out the problem impossible for the old world
to solve. America has gone far toward the goal. In time, all
nations will be persuaded to join her in attaining it.</p>

<p>9. Before we proceed with the chronology of the Christian
Era we must briefly notice the <i>one perfect man</i>, Jesus Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
To pronounce on the miraculous and divine claims made for
his character and deeds would carry us outside of our theme.
We can only deal with him as with other historical men, in his
historical character and relations. These are extremely remarkable.</p>

<p>That individual sprang, like Socrates, from the poorer
classes, and, like him without the advantages of education,
produced a system which proved a marvel of perfection, adapted
to all times, but most perfectly to the most perfect state of
mankind, and consequently growing up with the progress of
nations to an ever-increasing influence. Its moral precepts,
even in our day, are as far ahead of our civilization as that is
behind a perfect condition. This man made an extraordinary
impression. In three hundred years, by merely publishing
his ideas in a quiet way, which was the only mode the hostility
of the Roman rulers would permit, his followers overthrew the
prevailing religious systems which had been established as
many thousand years, and spread his influence world-wide.</p>

<p>His birth became the commencement of the Era of Humanity.
Like Socrates, he went about among the people with a
few chosen friends, setting forth his ideas, chiefly in conversation.
He did not write; the simple record of his life and a
few of his discourses being recorded by his disciples. Again,
like Socrates, his life was ended by violence. All the records
of that life show that he was as perfect as we can conceive. In
no respect does he seem to have wanted any feature of a noble
manhood, in any degree, nor to have shared the prejudices or
defects of his age. He lived as we may conceive man to live
when his mental and moral habits are accurately adjusted and
harmonized with his relations and his duties, which he has
learned perfectly to appreciate. His public career lasted but
three years and a half, and shines in history a beam of light.
He inspired his appreciative followers with rapturous admiration,
a passionate attachment to his person, and pleasure in
obedience to his teachings, stronger than death; and in those
whose plans and prejudices he crossed, and whose ambitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
he rebuked, a deadly hatred which could only be satisfied with
his blood.</p>

<p>10. Immediately after his death his followers commenced
to publish and enforce his teachings with great success, and on
the outbreak of persecution, without making opposition, they
scattered in all directions, proclaiming them with undiminished
zeal. Very soon their converts numbered tens of thousands,
in all parts of the Roman Empire. Persecution
increased their fervor and their numbers, without leading
them to revolt or resistance, until, in the course of time, an
emperor found it politic to profess Christianity. This high
patronage, and the active part the emperors took in the affairs
of the church from that time, had the effect to corrupt its
simplicity of manners, as the adhesion of Greek philosophers,
who imported into its doctrines their crude theories, adulterated
its teachings, and much that was quite foreign to its essential
character continued associated with its promulgation and
institutions for fifteen hundred years, and, indeed, remnants
of the same foreign element yet linger in it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the embarrassing load which the fantastic
distortion of its original simplicity and directness laid upon it,
it continued to exert great influence, and seems destined to
return, in time, to its original form and purity, and to employ
its primitive power to crown the work of civilization.</p>

<p>11. Such is the historical report of the man who introduced
into the process of human progress an element of unexampled
power. An impartial estimate of the influence of
Jesus Christ on history must allow that he is the most important
character that has ever appeared among men. The
unhappy association of his ideas with the vagaries of an
imperfect philosophy and the unwholesome ambitions of power,
greatly curtailed their usefulness; but the simple majesty of
his character and his discourses could not always be obscured,
and the luster of both has never shone more clearly nor exerted
more influence than they do in this age.</p>

<p>The course of the history of Christianity will be seen to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
intimately connected with every stage of advancement from
the time the Roman Empire began to wear out; it was the
nucleus which survived its fall, around which the surging
waves of invasion raged in vain, and which immediately began
the work of reconstruction.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHRISTIAN ERA.</span></h4>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">4—</span>By some chronological confusion the new era has been
made to begin four years before the appearance of the
founder of Christianity. When Augustus had settled
the whole empire he ordered the temple of Janus to be
closed and a census taken of all its inhabitants, which
numbered one hundred and twenty millions. On this
occasion Jesus Christ was born.</p>

<p><span class="date">10—</span>A Roman army under Varus was defeated and cut to
pieces in Germany. It was the severest defeat the
Romans had suffered since the overthrow and death
of Crassus, by the Parthians, sixty-three years before.</p>

<p><span class="date">14—</span>The Emperor Augustus died and was succeeded by his
step-son, Tiberius.</p>

<p><span class="date">29—</span>Jesus Christ was crucified by Pontius Pilate, Roman
governor of Judea, at the solicitation, and on the accusation,
of the leading Jews.</p>

<p><span class="date">37—</span>Tiberius died and was succeeded by Caligula. The
commencement of the reign of Tiberius was wise and
moderate, but he soon became violent and cruel. Caligula
was a still greater monster of wickedness.</p>

<p><span class="date">40—</span>Growing weary of his cruelty he was assassinated by
one of his officers, and his uncle, Claudius, was raised
to the throne. He was of feeble intellect and became
the tool of infamous favorites. He was poisoned by
order of his wife, Agrippina.</p>

<p><span class="date">54—</span>Nero, the son of Agrippina by a former husband, was
made emperor at seventeen years of age. He exceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
all description in folly, extravagance and crime. His
violence and barbarity fell generally on the patricians
and members of his court, but he was esteemed by the
common people, as were most of the emperors, who
spent vast sums on theatres and spectacles for their
amusement. The two bases of the empire were the
populace and the army. The emperor was terrible and
tyrannical chiefly to the patricians, while the army made
him formidable to the provinces and the barbarians.
A conflagration which some attributed to the orders
<span class="date">64—</span>of Nero lasted nine days and destroyed the greater
part of Rome. Nero cast the blame on the Christians,
who had become numerous, and raised a horrible persecution
against them.</p>

<p><span class="date">66—</span>The Jews rebelled and defied the Roman Empire.</p>

<p><span class="date">68—</span>Nero was dethroned by the Roman senate and army,
and committed suicide to avoid punishment for his
crimes.</p>

<p><span class="date">69—</span>Three emperors, Galba, Otho and Vitellius, were placed
on the throne in succession, but rebellions were raised
against them and all were put to death. Vespasian,
then besieging Jerusalem, was proclaimed emperor by
his army at the desire of the rulers of the eastern provinces,
and, in the same year, overcame all opposition
and commenced the first reign since Augustus that was
free from disgraceful profligacy and public crime.</p>

<p><span class="date">70—</span>Titus, the son of Vespasian, captured and destroyed
Jerusalem. Vespasian, during a reign of ten years,
restored order and prosperity to Rome and the empire,
but not without great labor and danger.</p>

<p><span class="date">79—</span>Titus succeeded as emperor, and was remarkable for
his clemency and care for his subjects. During his
reign occurred the most fearful eruption of the volcano
Vesuvius on record. Herculaneum and Pompeii, two
wealthy and flourishing cities, were destroyed, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
buried by the ashes. Pliny, an eminent writer, was
suffocated while observing the eruption.</p>

<p><span class="date">81—</span>Titus died, to the great grief and loss of mankind, and
was succeeded by his brother, Domitian, who was one
of the most infamous rulers that ever desolated the
earth. He raised a violent persecution against the
Christians for refusing to adore his statues and worship
him as a god. Among the victims was his own
cousin, Clemens, who had embraced Christianity. He
<span class="date">96—</span>was assassinated by his wife and officers in self-defense,
and the senate proclaimed Nerva, a native of Crete,
emperor. He was remarkable for his lenity and all the
gentle virtues. He was followed, after a reign of two
<span class="date">98—</span>years, by Trajan, whom he had adopted as his colleague
and successor, who is said to have been the greatest and
most deserving person of his time. He was, by birth,
a Spaniard, was wise and successful as a warrior and
statesman, and extremely noble as a man. He bridged
the Danube and the Euphrates rivers and conquered
both the Germans and Parthians on the north and east
of the empire. A stain on his memory was the persecution
of the Christians.</p>

<p><span class="date">117—</span>He was succeeded by Adrian, in whose reign all the
Roman laws, or annual edicts of the prætors, were
compiled into one body, and law assumed the dignity
of a science. He promoted literature, but continued
the persecution of the Christians. A rebellion of the
<span class="date">139—</span>Jews was punished with merciless severity. He was
followed by Antoninus Pius, who suspended all persecution
of Christians, promoted the best interests of all
parts of the empire, and introduced, during a prosperous
reign of twenty-two years, the most important
reforms into every part of the government.</p>

<p><span class="date">161—</span>Marcus Aurelius, called the Philosopher, succeeded.
He carried on a successful war with the Germans, and
made the welfare of his subjects his special care, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was seduced, by the pagan philosophers, into a persecution
of the Christians. Having discovered his error
he stopped it, toward the close of his reign. Commodus,
<span class="date">180—</span>his son, inherited the purple. He also inherited
a vicious and cruel disposition, and received a
demoralizing education from his mother. He was a
monster of vice and cruelty. He was assassinated in
<span class="date">192—</span>his bed by his own family and guards to save their
lives. Pertinax reigned three months, but, attempting
to restrain the license of the soldiery, he was murdered
by them. The soldiers in Rome then proclaimed that
the empire was for sale, and a rich merchant, Didius,
bought it from them and reigned in Rome two months,
<span class="date">193—</span>when he was also slain by the army. Septimus Severus,
an able general, seized the purple which he
secured against many rivals, and retained for eighteen
years. His vigor alone prevented general anarchy, but
he was systematically cruel.</p>

<p><span class="date">211—</span>Caracalla, his son, succeeded. He was a bloody and
atrocious tyrant, supported on the throne only by his
soldiers, whose aid he secured by large pay. He was
<span class="date">217—</span>murdered by the commander of his guards, Macrinus,
who succeeded in acquiring his place, but was soon
<span class="date">218—</span>murdered by the soldiers. They raised Heliogabalus,
a young Syrian priest of fourteen years of age, through
the assurance of his female relatives that he was the
son of Caracalla, to the purple. He is described as the
most cruel and infamous of all the Roman emperors.</p>

<p><span class="date">222—</span>After four years of horrible crime, he was slain in a
mutiny of his guard and his body thrown into the
Tiber. Alexander Severus succeeded. He was apparently
a secret admirer of Christianity and a model
<span class="date">235—</span>prince. He was murdered by Maximin, a Thracian
peasant, who had, by his valor, risen to high command
in the army, who seized the reins of power. He was
successful in war, but his severity provoked mutiny in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
<span class="date">238—</span>various parts of the empire, and he was slain by his
own soldiers. Gordian succeeded, a heroic youth of a
noble family. He was successful in war, but was murdered
<span class="date">244—</span>by his own prime minister, Philip, an Arabian,
who became emperor. He favored the Christians, and
reigned five years. In his reign, the thousandth year
of the foundation of Rome was celebrated by public
<span class="date">249—</span>games. He was slain in a revolt by Decius, the general
of his army, who occupied the throne. He raised a
most violent storm of persecution against the Christians,
who were despoiled of their goods and driven to
caves and deserts. From this time is dated the sect of
<span class="date">250—</span>anchorites, or hermits, who imagined they could acquire
superior holiness by abandoning society and devoting
themselves to meditation and prayer. The idea appears
to have been derived from the Persian Magians, who,
in this century restored the ancient dynasty and religion
of the Persians, or Parsees, in Persia. During the
political and social disorganization that soon commenced
the anchorites became numerous, and the system was
extensively prevalent for a thousand years to the great
injury of active and true Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="date">251—</span>Decius was slain in a battle with the Goths, who had
invaded the empire, and Gallus became emperor.</p>

<p><span class="date">253—</span>He was put to death by Emilianus, who attempted to
seize the reins of government, but the army elected
Valerian, governor of Gaul. The empire was invaded
by the Goths on the north and the Persians under their
king, Sapor, on the east. From this time, it had to
<span class="date">259—</span>fight for its life. Valerian was defeated by Sapor and
remained nine years in captivity, Gallienus, his son,
becoming emperor. He was extremely incompetent
and a multitude of rival claimants for the supreme
authority arose in all directions. They were called the
“Thirty Tyrants.” One of them, Odenatus, king of
Palmyra, in the Syrian desert, defeated Sapor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Gallienus proclaimed him his colleague. On the death
of Odenatus, his wife, Zenobia, assumed the title of
“Queen of the East,” conquered Egypt and ruled a
wide region with success and splendor. Both Goths
<span class="date">262—</span>and Persians invaded Asia Minor. Gallienus was murdered
<span class="date">268—</span>and Claudius succeeded. He defeated the Goths
<span class="date">270—</span>but died in a pestilence. Aurelian succeeded. He
was an able general. He subdued the Germans and
<span class="date">272—</span>Goths, and conquered Zenobia, one of the most remarkable
<span class="date">275—</span>women of history. Aurelian was assassinated by
some victims of his severity, and Tacitus, a Roman
senator succeeded, but died in seven months, and was
followed by Probus. He was a vigorous general, and
drove back the barbarians on all sides, but attempting
to employ his soldiers in labor on public works, they
<span class="date">282—</span>revolted and murdered him. Carus, the captain of the
<span class="date">283—</span>imperial guard, was raised to the throne. Dying the
next year, his sons, Carinus and Numerianus, inherited
his authority, but Numerianus was assassinated in a
<span class="date">284—</span>few months by his father-in-law, and Diocletian, said
to have been formerly a slave, was proclaimed emperor
by the army. This was called “The Era of the Martyrs,”
from the long and bloody persecutions against the Christians.
This was the tenth general attack on them, and
proved to be the last. The barbarians pressing in
great force on all sides, Diocletian appointed several
colleagues, and their united ability drove the invaders
back.</p>

<p><span class="date">305—</span>Diocletian resigned his power to Galerius, who appointed
three associates, making a division of the empire. One
of these, Constantius, died in Britain, and was succeeded
<span class="date">306—</span>by his son, Constantine. For a time, there were
six emperors, but one was killed, Galerius died, and
Constantine conquered the others.</p>

<p><span class="date">312—</span>Constantine changed the whole character of the empire
by embracing Christianity and relying largely on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
element for the support of his power, while he disbanded
the Pretorian, or royal Guard, which had for two hundred
years assumed to make and unmake emperors, and
whose example, imitated by the other armies, kept the
world periodically disturbed by the disputes and battles
of rival claimants to the imperial purple. By the
<span class="date">313—</span>edict of Milan, Constantine abolished all laws unfriendly
to Christianity; he restored the authority of the senate
and magistrates, and removed his capital from Rome to
Constantinople.</p>

<p><span class="date">324—</span>The pagan element was now so worn and decrepit that
no general disorders resulted. Whatever was left rallied
under Licinus, who was conquered by Constantine.
It appears to have been the strength of the Christian
element and its essential hostility to the Roman principle
of violent subjugation that produced so many and
fierce persecutions. Had it not been for the pressure
of barbarians on the empire the prevalence of that system
would have preserved society and the state for a
thousand years more, as it actually did in the Eastern
empire; but every thing that man has the management
of must be affected by his limitations, his mistakes and
his follies. Christianity needed a better ally, a fresher
and purer society, built up by the young blood and better
instincts of another and newer people.</p>

<p>Constantine paid great respect to the clergy of the
church and took a leading part in its general counsels—a
great mistake and a great misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="date">325—</span>His spiritual supremacy was virtually acknowledged at
the council of Nice which he convoked.</p>

<p><span class="date">330—</span>Constantine died leaving his vast dominions to his three
sons, who, in the course of ten years, were reduced to
one, Constantius. After a troubled reign of twenty
<span class="date">361—</span>years more, he died, and was succeeded by his cousin
Julian, called the “Apostate,” from his renouncing
Christianity and laboring to restore the pagan religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
In this he signally failed. He undertook to rebuild the
Jewish temple at Jerusalem, without success.</p>

<p><span class="date">363—</span>He was mortally wounded in an invasion of Persia, and
was succeeded by Jovian, who restored imperial favor
<span class="date">364—</span>to the Christian religion. He died after one years reign
and Valentinian was elected emperor by the council of
ministers and generals. He divided the empire with
his brother, Valens, and afterward Rome and Constantinople
usually had each an emperor. Valentinian died
<span class="date">375—</span>and was succeeded by his son, Gratian.</p>

<p><span class="date">378—</span>The Huns appeared in Europe, having wandered from
the borders of China, and defeated Valens with dreadful
slaughter. Valens himself was among the slain.
This was the commencement of the great migrations
that finally overwhelmed the Roman Empire of the west.</p>

<p><span class="date">379—</span>Gratian, left sole emperor, appointed Theodosius, called
The Great, his colleague, who subdued the Goths,
repelled the Huns, and restored order.</p>

<p><span class="date">383—</span>Gratian was murdered by the usurper Maximus.</p>

<p><span class="date">388—</span>Theodosius conquered and put Maximus to death and
restored Valentinian II., brother of Gratian, to the
throne of the western empire. In a few years the whole
<span class="date">394—</span>empire was reunited by the death of Valentinian.
Theodosius soon died, universally lamented, leaving the
two empires to his sons, Honorius and Arcadius.</p>

<p><span class="date">402—</span>Alaric, the Goth, invaded Italy and, though defeated,
endangered the safety of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="date">408—</span>Theodosius II. succeeded to the empire of the east.</p>

<p><span class="date">410—</span>Alaric again invaded Italy and sacked Rome. Alaric
soon after died and his forces were persuaded, by negotiations,
to leave Italy, but they permanently established
themselves in Spain and Southern Gaul (France). Thus
the empire began to fall to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="date">425—</span>Honorius died and Valentinian III. became emperor.</p>

<p><span class="date">429—</span>The Vandals soon conquered the Roman provinces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Africa, under their king, Genseric. They extended
<span class="date">440—</span>their conquests to Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="date">447—</span>Attila, called the “Scourge of God,” appeared at the
head of the Huns, and Theodosius made a humiliating
treaty with him to save his dominions from desolation.</p>

<p><span class="date">448—</span>In the next year the Saxons and Angles were invited
into Britain by the civilized Romans, to protect them
from the Picts and Scots, and laid the foundation of the
modern Anglo-Saxon race, and the Franks invaded Gaul
laying the foundations of the modern kingdom of France.
England received its name from the Angles—France
from the Franks.</p>

<p><span class="date">451—</span>Attila, the Hun, invaded Gaul, and was defeated at
<span class="date">452—</span>Chalons, by the united Romans and Visigoths. Attila
then invaded Italy and laid it waste, but died before he
<span class="date">454—</span>had completed the ruin of the empire. Valentinian III.
was murdered, and the Vandals from Sicily invaded
Italy and sacked Rome.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_XIII">SECTION XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RISE OF MODERN NATIONS.</span></h4>

<p><span class="date">476—</span>After a succession of puppet emperors in Rome, Odoacer
abolished the name and took the title of king of Italy.
He was a German in command of the auxiliaries in
Roman pay. Thus ended, in disaster and disgrace, the
once mighty Roman Empire. Its ruin was gradual
and the barbarians who overthrew it had already
embraced Christianity, so that the institutions of the
church did not share its fall.</p>

<p><span class="date">486—</span>Clovis, king of the Franks, defeated the Romans and
Gauls at the battle of Soissons. The Ostrogoths invaded
<span class="date">492—</span>Italy under Theodoric the Great, deposed Odoacer, and
founded a new kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="date">496—</span>Clovis defeated the invading Germans and embraced
<span class="date">500—</span>Christianity. Clovis next defeated the Burgundians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">507—</span>He subdued the Visigoths and all France was united
under one rule. He was of the Merovingian line, or
dynasty, of kings, which lasted over two hundred years,
during which the remains of Roman civilization and
the influence of the church were gradually modifying
and penetrating the character of a new and energetic
race.</p>

<p><span class="date">527—</span>Justinian became the ruler of the Eastern or Grecian
Empire.</p>

<p><span class="date">534—</span>His generals waged war with the Vandals in Africa
and the Ostrogoths in Italy, and after eighteen years
of conflict, succeeded in reconquering part of Italy,
which the Greek emperors continued to hold nominally
for about three hundred years; the seat of their representative
being at Ravenna. He was called an Exarch.
Rome itself was left, substantially, to the control of the
Christian bishop. When the Lombards founded a kingdom
<span class="date">568—</span>in the north of Italy they were prevented, by the
exarch and bishop, from spreading over the southern
part; and when the exarch threatened to become too
powerful to suit the views of the bishop, he supported
the Lombards. Thus the temporal or political power
of the popes arose, and they were the politic authors of
the “Balance of Power” theory, or system, that has
played so large a part in European history. The result
has been exceedingly favorable to progress in all directions,
since it has secured the independence of states, and
a more various and perfect civilization by the development
of the special genius of each people. Many circumstances
conspired to support this idea, in later times,
and render it very prominent and influential.</p>

<p>This gradual advance of the bishop of Rome in
political influence associated him with the mighty
memories of the “Eternal City,” and suggested the
idea of a spiritual empire over all Christendom, which
gradually became realized and quite changed the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of Christianity for near 800 years. Hurtful as it
ultimately became, by reviving a universal despotism
over conscience and freedom of thought, it was long
powerful for good by giving a common centre to
Europe, broken into fragments as it was by the rise of
feudalism. That was disorganizing; this was centralizing,
and kept the channels of communication open and
the missionary spirit and the elements of a restored
learning in activity. Its influence in commencing and
carrying forward the crusades, which substantially broke
the strength of feudalism, was of immense importance.</p>

<p><span class="date">622—</span>Mahomet arose in the Arabian peninsula, and his new
religion spread with astonishing rapidity. In one hundred
<span class="date">732—</span>years from the death of Mahomet the Saracens
had established a vast empire, covering two thirds of
the Roman empire, viz.: all of the old Persian empire,
Egypt, and all of northern Africa and Spain, and threatened
to inundate Europe. They poured a vast army
over the Pyrenees into France. This was defeated in a
great battle at Tours, by Charles Martel, who founded
a new dynasty, replacing the Merovingian, called the
Carlovingian, and made France the most powerful, as
it became the leading, nation in Europe, for promoting
civilization during many centuries.</p>

<p>By this means the center of political influence, “The
Star of Empire,” took another step westward. His
son, Pepin le Bref, or the Short, caused himself to be
<span class="date">752—</span>crowned king of France by the Roman Pontiff, Stephen
II., which added to his own prestige, as it also did to
that of the pope. It was a sort of league between the
rising temporal and spiritual powers in Europe, and set
an example long followed. Charlemagne, or Charles
the Great, the son of Pepin, ascended the throne in 771,
<span class="date">771—</span>and by his intelligence, energy, and wise statesmanship,
by his encouragement of learning, his organizing talents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and his success in conquering and civilizing the seething
mass of nationalities in Germany, he may be said
to have really founded modern civilization during his long
reign of forty-three years. He conquered the Lombard
kingdom in Italy, and was crowned by the pope, Adrian
I, “Emperor of the Romans,” kneeling at the altar in
Rome; but he virtually confirmed the temporal authority
of the popes, and associated their influence in all
his conquests. He thoroughly broke the spirit of the
pagan Saxons, in northwestern Germany, by a war of
thirty-three years, carried his conquests east over most
of the present Austrian empire, civilizing and bringing
the barbarians into the pale of Christendom by the aid
of Christian missionaries, and conquered some portions
of Spain from the Saracens.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the history of the western Roman
Empire, which had fallen three hundred years before,
was to be repeated. That was the hope and dream of
both Charlemagne and the Roman Pontiff, who joined
hands to realize it. This new western emperor had
great abilities and the church was very strong. The
centre of Europe had so long been within the reach of
civilizing influences, and had attained such a point of
development in its various nationalities, that they readily
accepted permanent institutions, when presented by
a power so strong as that of the mighty Frank ruler.</p>

<p><span class="date">814—</span>But when he died, it was found that there was no other
hand strong enough to wield his sceptre. All the
memories of the old empire, all the influence of the
Christian church, the remains of the Roman organization,
and the ripening vigor of new races, which had
begun to lay aside their barbarous impulses, were
united to aid the vast designs of this great statesman.
But the tendencies of the new society, in general, were
in a different direction. The Germanic civilization was
totally different from the Roman, and had there been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a succession of rulers as large minded and strong willed
as Charlemagne, they could not have repeated the history
of the ancient world. The tendency of the races
that overthrew the empire was invincibly against centralization,
and instead of a new Roman Empire in
western Europe, appeared the Feudal System.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="SECTION_XIV">SECTION XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FEUDAL SYSTEM.</span></h4>

<p>1. This system was the direct opposite of centralization.
Under it all Christendom broke up into fragments; the king
exerted but a loose general control, that continued to decrease
for several centuries; and most of the real authority was
exerted by the feudal lords from their fortified castles, which,
for three hundred years, had been springing up over all the
territory conquered from the Romans. It had its true origin
in the marked <i>personal assertion</i>, the strong <i>individuality</i> of
the Teutonic Race, which was, and is, one of its most prominent
traits. While in their native barbarous state their armies
were formed for their expeditions of foreign conquest, that
proved so fatal to the Romans, on the voluntary principle.
The prowess and fame of a leader, or chief, drew to him a
multitude of warriors, longing for activity and booty. So
long as he could lead them to success, to gain their individual
ends, they obeyed him. When he failed to reward their ambition
they held themselves free to leave him.</p>

<p>2. It was not immense disciplined armies, but innumerable
bands, organized in this way, that, through a long course
of years, gradually overran Britain, Gaul, Spain and Italy.
For four hundred years the civilized world had been accustomed
to the control and protection of a distant ruler whose
powerful armies rendered resistance vain, and all thought of
organization for self-protection against the terrible barbarians
was wanting when they were attacked. Each city or region
defended itself as well as possible, or submitted at once. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
conquerors took what they wanted and passed on to other
lands, or spread themselves out over the province. They
usually settled in the country parts, fortifying the country
seats of the richer inhabitants, or building themselves castles
near the larger towns, to hold them in awe. The leader considered
himself the owner of the conquered territory, and
divided it among his followers, who settled themselves, each
in his new domain, as its owner and ruler. The conquered
inhabitants were his subjects from whom he took tribute.
The conquerors were few in number in proportion to the conquered;
but there was little resistance throughout the old
Roman provinces. Organization and spirit were wanting to
them, and resistance would provoke complete ruin, since the
conqueror could easily call to his aid any number of his fellows
in return for a share of the spoils. Thus they gave what
was demanded and made themselves content with what was
left.</p>

<p>The cities paid tribute, the cultivators gave a portion of
their harvests to the new rulers. The territory not given to
his followers was considered the property of the original
leader. In return for the gift each of the recipients of territory
was held bound to aid him in his wars, and each larger
chief stood in similar relations to the king of his tribe or
nation. Out of this grew, at length, what was called the
Feudal System, feudal being derived, by some, from the old
German words “fee,” salary, and “od,” landed possessions—a
payment, or salary, in land, for services rendered, with a
certain obligation to the giver.</p>

<p>3. The kings of the Franks—the German nation that
conquered Gaul—up to the time of Charlemagne, labored to
consolidate their power and rule like the Roman emperors.
But the genius of their race and the peculiarities of the situation
were both opposed to that purpose. Charles Martel,
Pepin, his son, and Charlemagne, his grandson, were all rulers
of great vigor, and the last, apparently, succeeded for a time.
But the military strength lay only in the scattered feudal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
chieftains, each of whom sought to build up his own power
on his own estates. It was not possible to maintain a strong
central government for any length of time, or under an ordinary
man. For two hundred years these petty lords grew in
strength at the expense of the king. They were still held to
him by the necessity of supporting him in war, by a system
of checks, which, in time, were increased, and still more
enlarged, when the people began to make themselves felt in
the twelfth century; but from the fifth to the fifteenth century
feudalism was the prevailing system in all the civilized
European nations.</p>

<p>4. It was a very rude and violent period, but some of the
most happy traits of modern life grew out of it. The isolation
of the feudal lord in his fortified chateau or castle, where
his wife and children were his only equals, combined with the
constant influence of the church, gradually elevated the condition
of the woman, the rudeness and violence of the time
were modified by the rise of chivalry, which was, in great
part, founded on this new respect for the gentler sex, and sympathy
for her helpless condition when exposed, without a powerful
protector, to unrestrained insolence and passion; and
the feudal system held all the elements of society in suspense
until the mighty forces—revived learning, the printing press,
and a new commerce and industry—were ready to take a
prominent part in making it what we now find it—far superior
to the old society.</p>

<p>5. Feudalism held men apart, and individually subject to
the refining influence of Christian precepts, from the fifth to
the ninth century, when the romantic practice of chivalry
became popular as a relief from the tedium of isolation, and
a channel for the flow of the softer sentiments of respect for
woman, of compassion for weakness, and, at the same time,
a vent for the martial spirit which the constant conflicts of
the time cultivated. The age of chivalry indicates that Christianity
was powerfully moulding the character of the new
nations. Working on qualities as stern and rude as those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the old Roman of the Republic, its partial control, the beginnings
of its power, were manifested in a romantic way. The
isolation of feudal life, and a sense of wrong in employing all
their energies in unceasing contests of ambition produced the
chivalric outbreak and the crusades. The knights of chivalry
were feudal lords and gentlemen, trained in all the warlike
arts of the period and in all the courtesies which the new
influence of female society produced. When starting forth
as knight-errants, they were exhorted by the stern feudal warrior
to valor, and by the Christian priest to gentleness toward
the weak and defenseless, and they made it the business of
life to wander about on horseback incased in armor, displaying
their warlike accomplishments and combatting petty
tyranny. There was little power in the king to right the
wrongs of his subjects, and brutal violence in the feudal lords
had no other effectual punishment. Chivalry flourished for
more than five hundred years; but its most useful days were
from 1000 to 1200. It was the first, and seems to later times
a somewhat amusing indication of a more humane social
state than the world had ever known.</p>

<p>6. The crusades commenced about 1100, the object being
to rescue the sepulcher of the founder of Christianity from
unbelievers. It first engaged the sympathy of the people at
large, then of the feudal nobility and finally interested the
ambition of kings. For two hundred years a large part of
the best blood of Europe was poured out in Palestine in a
vain effort to expel the Saracens from it. The transportation
of armaments and supplies to that country from various parts
of Europe gradually led to commerce and skill in navigation;
so much of ancient civilization and knowledge as still existed
in the Eastern, or Greek Empire at Constantinople, was introduced
into modern Europe, which at the same time was relieved
of its more turbulent and adventurous elements; and
a heavy blow was given to the smaller feudal proprietors by
the expense incurred in a distant expedition where they died
without issue, reduced their families to poverty, or whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
they returned penniless to mortgaged estates. It rapidly
hastened the movement, begun by other influences, to reduce
the number of feudal proprietors, and render government
more vigorous over increasingly large territories.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_XV">SECTION XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE.</span></h4>

<p>1. Between 1000 and 1200 the independent and enterprising
spirit—the individualism—that we have seen at the base
of European character, and which first produced the Feudal
System, began to move among the masses in various ways and
laid the foundation for that influence of the People that was
afterward to become the most powerful element in political
life.</p>

<p>It first presented itself in the development of industrial arts
and commerce in cities which obtained, as corporations, the
rights, or a part of the rights, of the feudal proprietor, which
they proceeded to exercise under the form of Free Cities in
Germany, privileged Communes in France and commercial
Republics in Italy.</p>

<p>2. A second development, highly favorable some centuries
later to the reaction of popular freedom against centralizing
despotism in the government, was the religious protest against
the claims of the church over freedom of thought. This spirit
grew up in Germany, and its first remote beginnings are to be
found in the imperial title conferred by the pope on Charlemagne.
In the course of time (<span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span> 963) that title was inherited
by the German rulers who, for a long time, struggled for
the control of Italy and a feudal superiority over the popes.
This was carried on for two centuries with much acrimony,
in which the terms Guelph, the general name of those who
supported the side of the popes, and Ghibellines, of those who
rallied to the emperor, came to be the watchwords of Germany
and Italy. The popes triumphed in this contest, which prevented
the establishment of a vast and powerful political despotism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and gave the church a temporal kingdom in a part
of Italy, with an immense spiritual empire highly embarrassing
to free mental growth. The reaction against this
spiritual control produced the Protestant Reformation of the
sixteenth century, in which was wrapped up the germ of modern
Republicanism.</p>

<p>3. The Crusades loosened the bonds of Feudalism, taught
nations and rulers to act together to gain a common object,
enlarged the experiences of men immensely, and cultivated and
organized the spirit of personal adventure which afterwards
expended itself on commerce.</p>

<p>It was at about the crisis of this period (1215, <span class="smcapuc">A. D.</span>) that
the Magna Charta—the foundation of English constitutional
liberty—was produced; that the Hanseatic League and Free
Cities began to flourish in Germany; the commercial republics
of Venice, Genoa and Florence rose in Italy; and the communal
corporations in France sprang up. They were all more or less
stimulated by influences growing out of the Crusades, and
brought forward the <i>people</i> and their distinct and separate
interests and activities into political importance. This was
the beginning of an entirely new order of things, which required
a new continent for its full development.</p>

<p>4. A first circumstance, above all favorable to the liberties
of the people, was the Invention of Printing, producing rapid
diffusion of information, the coincident revival of learning
and the foundation of modern science. All these, working
together with various other agencies, gradually swept away
feudalism, checked the towering spiritual tyranny of the church
and corrected a crowd of minor evils that embarrassed society,
enterprise, and progress in the science of government.</p>

<p>The intermediate stage in this progress appeared like a return
to old principles. The dissolution of feudalism left the governments
of Europe centralized. The lords inheriting feudal
rights had become intolerable despots. For a certain period
the authority of the king was the bulwark behind which the
people sheltered themselves from the oppressions of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
feudal superiors, and they united with him to reduce the feudal
nobility to the comparatively harmless condition of the modern
aristocracy, whose greatest distinction is social pre-eminence.
It left them, indeed, a high, but not overwhelming, position
in the body politic, which the growing education and wealth
of the middle and lower classes constantly tended to reduce.
This change was commencing when America was discovered.
The feudal chiefs labored to extend and strengthen their power
at the expense of each other, of the king and the people. The
increasing activity and importance of commerce, trade and industry
required the support of a broad legislation that could
not be obtained while nations were broken up into petty lordships,
principalities and kingdoms almost independent of
each other, and whose rulers were often hostile to or at war
with each other; while the support of so many rulers became
a heavy burden on the resources of the people. The king represented
the nation and was the rallying point of reform. To
strengthen him was to promote the larger interests of the
country.</p>

<p>5. For these reasons, and from the resistance offered by
the feudal institutions, which had existed a thousand years,
authority became centralized in the monarch to an extravagant
degree, and this at a time when freer institutions were
most required by the larger and wiser views of the people.
The great usefulness of the Roman Catholic Church in civilizing
and educating the modern nations and founding a center
or common bond between them, which produced a degree of
unity in their progress, had continually added to her power,
while the disposition to free thought was ever becoming more
pronounced. Thus two despotic forces, each claiming absolute
obedience in their respective spheres, were rising in strength
to a degree extremely embarrassing to the growing intelligence
and increased activities of the commonalty. The traditional
authority of the church and the king came, in the
course of a hundred years after the discovery of America, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
directly oppose the most important interests and instincts of
mankind.</p>

<p>6. The progress of the people, as distinct from that of
their governments, may then be described as starting in the
last great service done for Europe by the church—the organization
of the Crusades. The feudal system separated men
too much for healthy progress, and this singular display of
religious zeal united the various nationalities in a common
effort, and stirred up powers that had long slumbered. It
was in this period that the adventurous and comprehensive
activities of modern life commenced. Wealth had been
largely confined to the feudal nobility. It now began to flow
out through the general community. The nobles expended
vast sums in fitting out princely retinues to lead to the Holy
Land, for which their estates were security. They died, or
returned penniless, and their lands passed into the hands of
the commercial classes, whose successful diligence had made
them wealthy. It was the first heavy blow to feudal institutions,
and laid the foundation of the power of the people.</p>

<p>Corporations and cities which had obtained the rights of
feudal proprietors, employed them for the purposes of self-government,
and so used an instrument of despotism to shield
and sustain a virtual democracy. With this freedom of
action, popular liberty, controlled in a general way by feudal
obligations to the prince, king, or emperor, grew fast and
strong protected by the growing despotisms of the church and
the state. The Hanseatic League, in the north of Germany,
was, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, perhaps as
wealthy and powerful as any king or emperor in Christendom;
and in the sixteenth, the small commercial province of the
Netherlands could defy the whole power of Spain, with the
wealth of the Indies at her back.</p>

<p>7. The revival of learning, and the invention of the art of
printing, gave an immense impulse to this uprising of the
people, commenced near three hundred years before; about
the same time the Portuguese discovered the way to India by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the Cape of Good Hope, Columbus threw open the “Gates
of the West,” and the wealth of both Indies flowed in a full
stream through the channels of commerce and trade; that is
to say, into the hands of the busy and industrious people.
All events seemed to conspire to build up a base for the power
and development of the commonalty.</p>

<p>This growing intelligence and strength among the masses,
with the habit of ruling themselves under feudal forms, made
a conflict with the two arrogant despotisms inevitable in the
near future. Feudal institutions were still a serious and vexatious
embarrassment to freedom of movement, and a very
heavy tax on industry, and the only legal way to remove it
was by strengthening the central or kingly power, which continued
to increase for more than a hundred years; but the
conflict with priestly despotism was entered on at once. A
vast rebellion against the church commenced, called “The
Reformation of the Sixteenth Century,” which embraced
nearly all the most enterprising and commercial nations.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_XVI">SECTION XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SITUATION ON THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.</span></h4>

<p>1. We have said that great men were a kind of summary
of the tendencies of their period; an expression of a wide-spread
thought or state of mind, which their fortunate combination
of faculties and more favorable circumstances enabled
them first to state, or embody, with distinctness; that the great
following they obtained, and the extensive influence which
enabled them to make great changes, were due to a coincident
development in their generation of the same thoughts and
tendencies. This explains the existence of <i>eras</i> in all departments
of life. Men grow, or progress, silently, from one to
the other; when the general progress has reached the suitable
point it breaks out in a leader more bold and positive than
the rest.</p>

<p>The discovery of America was such an era; and the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
advance in many ways at about the same time was the result
of gradual growth during many centuries. It was shown by
the sudden appearance of great men in different spheres.
Columbus lived in the midst of a great era. Printing, the use
of the compass, the science of astronomy and the successful
protest against spiritual despotism all commenced their great
career just before, or just after him. The great painters,
whose works are now so much esteemed, were all living in
1500. Copernicus discovered the true planetary system in the
year Columbus died. Gunpowder, which enabled Cortez to
conquer the Mexican Empire, came into general use about the
same period. Luther commenced the Reformation, while the
first adventurers were creeping, with amazed curiosity, around
the shores of the American continent. The foundation of all
the sciences was then laid. Correct principles were enunciated
for religion, government and thought; and the laws of nature,
of human relations and of religious liberty were promulgated
almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>2. But not all the European nations, and not <i>all</i> of any one
nation, were prepared for this vast advance. The southern part
of Germany, and the people in general in southern Europe,
resisted what they regarded as a dangerous innovation, and
the reform spread only north and west. The close connection
instituted by Constantine between church and state, which was
renewed under Charlemagne, raised at this time, a long series
of religious wars, which contributed to embarrass Protestantism
in the same way by the necessity under which it lay, (or
supposed it lay,) of seeking the protection of princes.
Luther’s reorganized church became the state religion of
northern Europe, and fell under government control in
Switzerland and Holland. Henry VIII. of England, while
yielding, like a true Englishman, to the general tendency of
his people, in taking the reformed faith under his protection
constituted himself its head.</p>

<p>In the long contest between Catholic and Protestant, it
became apparent that full religious liberty was not then possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in Europe; and the more, that a political element was
involved in the contest. Free thought naturally led to free
institutions, and the leading European governments were,
by the breaking up of feudalism, centralized and made
more despotic than ever. Thus its tendency to political
revolution organized strong governments against it, or prevented
its development by the check of governmental
supremacy.</p>

<p>3. While this contest was working itself out in the firm
establishment of Protestantism under state patronage in northern
Europe, and its entire extinction in the stronger and more
conservative southern monarchies, the discovery and subjugation
of Mexico and Peru, with their wealth of precious metals
and tropical productions, together with the trade with the East
Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, passage to which was discovered
before the daring venture of Columbus, had greatly enriched
Europe. A large part of this wealth passed immediately, or in
process of time, into the hands of the people as the result of personal
adventure or of the activity of commerce, trade and industry.
The maritime regions of northern Germany, Holland and
England gathered much of this golden fruit; the maritime
republics of Italy fell into decay; and Spain spent its vast treasures
in war. It was led to this suicidal policy by various royal
marriages which united the German Empire, Spain and the
Netherlands under one scepter. This vast ascendancy, united
with great wealth, excited the alarm of other nations, and contributed
to strengthen the Reformation. The Protestant
princes of Germany and the king of France united to reduce
this dangerous pre-eminence in order to uphold the existing
nationalities of Europe, or the Balance of Power, as it was
called. Thus the emperor, Charles V., was led to pour out
the treasures of Mexico and Peru to sustain his political
aspirations, and his wars turned the wealth of the Indies into
the channels of commerce and industry.</p>

<p>His successor, Philip II., still uniting Spain and the Netherlands,
undertook to crush the reformed faith in the latter states,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and failed in a war of nearly half a century. This vast expense
made Spain, the richest country of Europe, the poorest, still
to the profit of commerce and the greater strength of Protestant
lands. The United Netherlands became free Protestant
states and remarkably prosperous.</p>

<p>4. The English people advanced in laying the foundations
of a free constitution from the time of the Magna Charta in
1215. They became strongly Protestant, and finally their
commons engaged in a contest with the king, Charles I., for
the maintenance of popular rights. He resisted to the last
extremity, and the commons precipitated a revolution that
dethroned and beheaded him, and established a republic. This
was premature and expired with the great leader, Cromwell,
who had successfully headed it. Royal power was restored,
but a few years later was rearranged and so modified as to be
suited to the independent but moderate tendencies of the people.
A certain part of the English people, however, aspired
to more complete liberty than a monarchy could afford them,
and passed over the sea to secure freedom of conscience and
political enfranchisement in the New World.</p>

<p>With the moderate and steady maintenance of their rights,
characteristic of Englishmen, they were governed under charters
from the English sovereigns who, for the sake of extending
their dominions, allowed them much freedom. European
governments could not conform to the demands of progress by
loosening the bands of arbitrary rule, and the new colonies
became the refuge of such as aspired to more liberal institutions,
as well as of adventurers in search of gain. Thus the
English colonies became the escape valve of European politics
and society, the Appendix of the Reformation, and the Hope
of Liberty.</p>

<h4 id="SECTION_XVII">SECTION XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCLUSION.</span></h4>

<p>1. We see here again the operation of the constant law
that impelled men, or moved the “Star of Empire,” westward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The form of the continents, the character of the surface
and the climate, provided a natural and desirable opening
only in that direction. The overplus of population, the discontent
of some part of the people with existing government,
the restlessness of adventurers, or the requirements of trade
and commerce produced a migration. The colony, instructed
by the experience of the parent state, was free to improve on
its institutions. Colonies have almost always prospered more
than the mother country. Transplanting seemed to improve
both the stock and the institutions. Greece was colonized
from Asia, as was Rome; Miletus, Syracuse, and other Greek
colonies excelled the mother cities in wealth, and though the
free structure of Grecian government allowed a natural development
at home and made Athens the metropolis, yet its
marvelous genius was nourished and stimulated by the colonies.
Carthage was greater and stronger than Tyre, and
contended with Rome for the control of the world; the most
western nations of Europe were colonized from Rome and
Germany, and have taken the lead in later progress, while
America has always displayed the lusty, fertile vigor of a
young life.</p>

<p>Thus the conformation of the surface of the earth, and the
peculiarly fruitful character of a transplanted civilization,
have always furnished an escape from the embarrassing fixity
of an old state, in the same western direction, and the old
and the new unite to establish frequent stages of progress.
In this way a continuous growth has been secured that
impresses on advancing culture the same unity, from first to
last, that we see in the growth and mental development of
the individual man.</p>

<p>2. We have seen the aggregation and primary discipline
of mankind in the simple but extensive despotisms of western
Asia, varied in Palestine by a theocratic system which has
produced the world’s great religion, and in Egypt by the predominance
of a learned priestly caste. We saw an improvement
made in Greece to meet the demands of intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
development. Their intelligence, however, was a spontaneous
outburst, of necessity immature. Two thousand years of
training, and the addition of many new elements were
required before mind could <i>rule</i> the world; but Greece, by
the attractiveness of her art and culture, set men at work on
the great problem of politics and life.</p>

<p>Rome followed to organize government and consolidate the
civilizations, to ripen their fruit and transmit the seed to a
more favorable time, and to new and better races. A complete
civilization was impossible without well digested science,
which had its remote roots in Greece; and law, which was
gradually produced by the grand Roman republic; and a clear
understanding of the profound yet simple precepts of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>3. Western Europe received all the wisdom and experience
of the ancient world, and labored well at the grand problem,
though she did not completely solve it. She, however, made
an immense advance toward it, and her children, rich in
her experience, instructed at once by her success and her mistakes,
and aided always by her wisdom, found (let us hope) in
America the goal of their noblest aspirations. Thus we
find the spirit of progress traversing the whole course of
human history, constantly advancing through all the confusion
of rising and falling states, of battle, siege and slaughter,
of victory and defeat; through the varying fortunes and ultimate
extinction of monarchy, republic and empire; through
barbaric irruption and desolation, feudal isolation, spiritual
supremacy, the heroic rush and conflict of the Cross and the
Crescent; amid the busy hum of industry, through the marts
of trade and behind the gliding keels of commerce; through
the bloody conflicts of commons, nobles, kings and kaisers to
New and Free America. There the Englishman, the German,
the Frenchman, the Italian, the Scandinavian, the Asiatic and
the African all meet as equals. There they are free to speak,
to think, and to act. They bring their common contributions
of character, energy and activity to the support and enlargement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of a common country, and the spread of its influence
and enlightenment through all the lands of their origin. As
America is the common ground on which all the currents and
ideas of all the civilizations meet, so also it is the point from
which return currents, hastened by lightning and by steam,
seek again every quarter of the earth with kindly greetings,
to renew the relations broken in the original separation of the
races, and to cement, by exchanges mutually profitable, a new
and better unity of mankind. As the heart in the human
body receives the current of blood from all parts of the
system, and, having revitalized it, returns it with fresh
elements of strength, so America adopts the children of all
lands only to return a manhood ennobled by a sense of its
own dignity through the practice of a system of self-government
which improves the condition and promotes the interest
of each while it produces harm to none.</p>

<p>4. America, then, will colonize Ideas, extensively, when her
institutions are thoroughly matured. The process, indeed,
commenced with her birth, and her Spirit sails with her ships
in every sea and visits all lands. All the past has contributed
to the excellence of her foundation, and modern Europe has
supplied her with the most desirable building material both
of ideas and of men. Without Asia, Greece and Rome, there
would have been a very imperfect modern Europe; and
without modern Europe, America must have begun at the
beginning, with all the lessons, discoveries and discipline of
thousands of years to learn. Happily, we seem authorized to
believe that, as she concludes the possible great migrations
of humanity, she has so well learned the lessons of experience
as to have given due flexibility and capacity of improvement
to all her institutions, and, when necessary can <i>reconstruct</i>
herself <i>within</i> herself. If this be true, she will reach the goal
of all progress by furnishing to each individual among her
citizens such aid as a state can give to make the most of
himself, to reach the fullest expression of his value.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.</span></h3>

<p>1. Civilization, or the history of it, at least, commenced in
the Eastern continent. The Western was, until a comparatively
recent period, quite unknown to those who recorded the
progress of mankind, and the events by which it was marked.
The science of the most learned men and nations of ancient
times did not extend to a comprehension of geography beyond
the limits of their own countries, and of the countries conquered
by their rulers, or those which, bordering on these, held some
relations with them.</p>

<p>2. The world appeared to be a flat surface, and no one
thought of questioning that it was so <i>only</i> in appearance. It
was reserved for a daring Genoese sea captain, about four hundred
years ago, to conceive the happy idea that this appearance was
deceptive; that it was really round; and that, by sailing westward,
the distant East, or India, might be readily reached.
Columbus, having become fully satisfied that this theory was
correct, and not being rich enough to fit out an expedition
himself, endeavored to convince others, who had the means, of
the truth of his views, and to induce them to aid him to put
them to the test.</p>

<p>3. The Genoese, living by commerce, and, at that time
wealthy and powerful, gave him no encouragement. They
even regarded him as a madman. He applied to the Governments
of Portugal, England, and Spain, but gained little
attention for many years. At length Queen Isabella, of Spain,
became interested in his theories, and, with much effort, assisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
him to put them to proof. He set sail August 3, 1492,
with three small vessels, on an unknown sea. His crew were
filled with fear to find themselves so far from land, and sailing
toward unknown dangers. He had great difficulty in calming
their terrors, and was in great danger of perishing in the
mutiny they contemplated. He was saved by the opportune
appearance of land on the 11th of October. He had reached
the group of islands lying between North and South America.
The one first discovered was called, by the natives whom he
found inhabiting it, Guanahani. He named it, in remembrance
of his peril, San Salvador—St. Savior. Supposing he
had reached the Indies lying to the eastward of Asia, and not
dreaming of a new continent, he called the inhabitants Indians.
Cuba and Hayti, larger islands lying further south, were soon
after discovered, and he hastened to carry back the wonderful
tidings of his discovery to Spain. He reached home seven
months and eleven days after his departure.</p>

<p>4. He and his discoveries immediately became famous. The
world had never been struck with a surprise so great, and all
Europe was in a ferment at the news. He soon returned as
Viceroy of the newly discovered lands, to establish a colony
and extend his researches. Five years later, in 1498, he discovered
the main land near the river Orinoco, in the northern
part of South America. He died in 1506, unaware of the
magnitude of his discoveries, still believing he had only reached
India from the west, and treated with much ingratitude by the
government he had so much benefited by his bold genius.
The first published account of the new continent was by a
Florentine, Amerigo Vespucci, who visited the main land in
1499, claimed the merit of the discovery, and gave it his name,
America. His claim has long been disallowed, and Columbus
duly honored as the real discoverer, though the name was never
changed.</p>

<p>5. It is believed that North America was known to the mariners
of the North of Europe as early as the tenth century;
and that settlements, that afterwards perished, were made from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Iceland and Greenland as far south as the shores of New
England. This, however, is only a dim tradition, there being
no detailed and authentic history of these events left on
record so far as is yet known.</p>

<p>6. An English mariner, by descent a Venitian, disputes
with Columbus the first sight of the main continent in 1498.
He first touched the coast of Labrador, and sailed as far south
as Florida in the next year. It was near a hundred years
later before a permanent settlement was made within the territory
that is now the United States, by the English, though
the city of St. Augustine was founded in Florida by the Spaniards
in 1565.</p>

<p>In 1607 a settlement was made at Jamestown, on the Potomac
river, in Virginia, and in 1620 the Puritans of England,
persecuted there for their religious views, sought liberty of
worship in the new world, establishing a colony at Plymouth,
in the eastern part of New England. Others followed in
succession until many distinct colonies had been planted on
the eastern coast of the United States; all of which—except
Florida, belonging to the Spaniards, on the south, and Canada,
settled by the French, on the north—were under the control
of, and received their laws from, England.</p>

<span class="smaller">CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN COLONIES,
FROM 1763 TO JULY 4, 1776.</span></h3>

<p>In February, 1763, The Peace of Paris, concluded between
the governments of England and France, closed the war in
America that had been so painful to the colonies from the
part which the French persuaded the Indians to take in it.
But, while the colonies bore a large part of the burden, (they
had raised $16,000,000 of its expenses, and had lost, in battle
or in hospital, 30,000 men,) of a war that drove the French
out of all their possessions in Canada and east of the Mississippi
river; they were, at the same time, trained to act in concert,
which paved the way for a future confederation, and
hardened them to war. Being called into battle under celebrated
English commanders, and to fight side by side with European
veterans, they had opportunity to learn the art of war, as well
as to compare themselves with the soldiers of the mother country
and of France. This comparison was favorable to them,
and inspired them with confidence in their own ability.</p>

<p>The fatal blunders of Gen. Braddock, and the skill and bravery
of Washington and his provincial troops which, alone,
saved the British army from entire annihilation in the Pennsylvania
wilderness, was never forgotten. They felt themselves,
even as raw militia, equal to the best European soldiers,
when on their own ground.</p>

<p>It was a great mistake of the Home Government to put on
an arrogant tone with them just when they had learned their
strength. In the year 1764 that government, plunged in debt
by its long wars with the continental powers, (it amounted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
$700,000,000,) and on the plea that the colonies who had been
protected, should bear a fair share of the pecuniary burden,
determined to impose taxes on them. Previously they had
restricted their commerce to English ports, had laid duties on
various imports, and assumed authority to change the governments
of the colonies without their consent. This had produced
much dissatisfaction, but had no further immediate effect
than to lead them to remonstrance, evasion, or legal resistance.
The proposal to lay <i>internal taxes</i> was quite another affair.
Submission to this they thought would be fatal to their liberties.
They resisted with general moderation, respectfully, but
with determined resolution.</p>

<p>The British ministry were provoked by this resistance, holding
it to be rebellion; and determined to put it down, by force,
if need be. The struggle continued for ten years with growing
obstinacy on either side. The home government was
exceedingly obtuse or it would have either proceeded to extremes
at once or yielded the whole case, as it finally determined
to do in 1776, when it was too late. In this period of
lively discussion, and of organization to secure the strength of
union in resistance, the separate colonies were gradually
moulded into a nation, imbued with common sympathies and
ideas, and moved by common interests. They had not thought
of independence during all this preliminary struggle. The
war had lasted a year before that idea became prominent.
That was not, even then, regarded as an <i>end</i>, so much as an
indispensable <i>means</i> to secure their liberties. Thus we see
that no taint of <i>conspiracy</i> attached to the revolutionary
struggle. The colonies were thoroughly loyal, until loyalty
came to mean loss of liberty, and the rights enjoyed by Englishmen
in England. The exercise of arbitrary power they
felt it right to resist; but they exhausted all other modes and
means of resistance before they resorted to arms.</p>

<p>They did not even make a first attack. They waited till
armies were sent to subjugate them, and until those armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
commenced the attack; then the whole country rose in the
stern resolve to right their wrongs.</p>

<h4>1763.</h4>

<div class="chronology">

<p>The Peace of Paris was signed in February of this year.
July 7th began “Pontiac’s War,” with the simultaneous attack
on all the forts in the peninsula of Michigan, and the whole
frontier of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pontiac was an
Ottawa chief, of great ability, and had drawn many Indian tribes
into the war. It was virtually ended in September of the
same year.</p>

</div>

<h4>1764.</h4>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">April 5.—</span>“The Sugar Act” was passed in the English Parliament.
This levied duties on coffee, pimento, French
and East India goods, and forbade iron and lumber
to be exported except to England. It was for the
avowed purpose of raising a revenue, and raised
instead a storm of indignation. The Massachusetts
House of Representatives said: “If we are taxed
and not represented, we are slaves.”</p>

</div>

<h4>1765.</h4>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">Feb. 27—</span>Was passed the obnoxious Stamp Act. Also the
military law was made to authorize the ministry to
send any number of troops to the colonies, for whom
the colonists were to find “quarters, fire-wood, bedding,
drink, soap, and candles.”</p>

<p><span class="date">May 29—</span>Patrick Henry introduced five “Resolutions” into the
Virginia House of Burgesses, claiming for Virginians
the rights of British subjects; that only their
own representatives could lawfully tax them; declaring
the attempt to vest that power in any other
hands subversive of both British and American
liberty.</p>

<p><span class="date">Sept. 1—</span>The Pennsylvania Assembly passed similar resolutions.</p>

<p><span class="date">Oct. 7—</span>A congress of delegates, or committees, from nine
colonies, met in New York. It was the first Continental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Congress. Its spirit harmonized with that
of Massachusetts, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and
its “Declaration of Rights and Grievances” was cordially
approved by all the colonial assemblies.</p>

<h4>1766.</h4>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">Mar. 29—</span>The Stamp Act could not be enforced in America,
and it was repealed by Parliament; but the repeal
was followed by another act asserting the power and
right of Parliament “to bind the colonies in all
cases whatsoever.” Thus yielding the <i>thing</i> and asserting
the <i>principle</i>, they both strengthened the
colonies by a sense of their power, and exasperated
them by a total denial of their Declaration of Rights.</p>

<p><span class="date">May—</span>Yet their triumph filled the colonies with joy, and
gratitude toward the King and their English friends.

<p><span class="date">June—</span>But their exultation was short-lived. In this year
taxes were levied on tea, paints, paper, glass, and

the colonies, to pay no more taxes or duties at all.</p>

<p><span class="date">Oct. 28—</span>The Governor of Massachusetts having refused to
call the General Court (or legislative body of the colony)
together, a public meeting was held and resolutions
passed to encourage “economy, industry, and

subscribers to an agreement to discontinue the importation
of British goods not absolute necessaries.
This was imitated in other colonies.</p>

rescind this circular, refused by a vote of ninety-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>

this day. Their main effort was to vindicate the
<span class="date">” 28—</span>colony from the charge of a rebellious spirit. The

<span class="smaller">FORMATION OF THE ORIGINAL UNION.</span></h3>

<p>“The Boston Tea Party” provoked the English Parliament
into passing “The Boston Port Bill,” closing that city to commerce.
This act led to immediate measures for assembling
delegates, representing twelve colonies in North America
(Georgia, only, was not represented), for the purpose of consultation
on the measures required for the protection of colonial
rights. This body, called “The Continental Congress,” assembled
in Philadelphia, September 5, 1774. It drew up a
“Declaration of Colonial Rights;” and, for the purpose of
enforcing them, agreed to accept as a basis of common action
fourteen articles, known as “The American Association.”</p>

<p>This was the origin of the American Union. Though it did
not assume organic political power, and its ordinances were
only advisory in form, it was better obeyed than most governments.
Arrangements were made for another Congress in May
following. Its day of meeting was hastened by the battle of
Lexington, and it immediately proceeded to assume the powers
of a General Government, at the request of <i>some</i> of the
provincial Legislatures, and with the tacit consent of <i>all</i>. It
received its authority from its representative character; from
the imperious necessity of a head to organize and direct; and
from the voluntary obedience rendered to its mandates. It
performed all the functions of a government until all prospect
of reconciliation with Great Britain was lost, when, June 11,
1776, a committee was appointed to prepare “A Declaration
of Independence.” This was adopted and signed July 4,
1776.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 12th of July, a committee of one from each State
reported on the terms of confederation, and the powers of Congress;
but differences of opinion, and the pressure of military
affairs prevented action on it. On the 9th of September, 1776,
the name “United Colonies of America” was discarded for
that of “United States of America.” Georgia had appointed
delegates on the 4th of July, so that there were “Thirteen
United States.”</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 15, 1777, “Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union of the United States of America” were
agreed to in Congress, and sent to the States for approval.
Eight of the State Legislatures had ratified these articles on
the 9th of July, 1778; one ratified July 21st; one July 24th;
one November 26th, of this year; one February 22d, 1779;
and the last, March 1, 1781.</p>

<p>This document was little more than a digest of the powers
before assumed by Congress, and tacitly acknowledged by the
States from the commencement of the war. This, now legal,
bond had existed before as a free, though unspoken, submission
to the dictates of prudence and patriotism.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</span></h3>

<p>This immortal state paper—“the general effusion of the soul
of the country” at the imperiled state of liberty, and of the
rights of Englishmen—was given to the world on the 4th of
July, 1776. The war of the Revolution had been raging more
than a year, and many of the leading minds of the country
had been actuated by the hope that their wrongs would be
redressed, and the mother country and her colonies reconciled.
The course of events had convinced them, however, that there
would be no redress, and that no reconciliation was possible
other than that based on a slavish surrender of rights and privileges
dear to free men.</p>

<p>And hence a more decided course was approved by the
people, and finally adopted by their delegates in Congress, on
the 2d day of July, 1776. This resolution changed the old
thirteen British colonies into free and independent States.
And now it remained to set forth the reason for this act,
together with the principles that should govern this new people.
By this declaration the new Republic, as it took its place
among the powers of the world, proclaimed its faith in the
truth, reality, and unchangeableness of freedom and virtue.
And the astonished nations, as they read that all men are created
equal, started out of their lethargy, like those who have
been exiled from childhood when they suddenly hear the dimly
remembered accents of their mother tongue.</p>

<p class="center">THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</p>

<p>When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary
for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected
them with another, and to assume among the powers of
the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of
nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right
of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new
government, laying its foundation on such principles, and
organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed,
will dictate that governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all
experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right them by abolishing
the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long
train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism,
it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such
government, and to provide new guards for their future
security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies,
and such is now the necessity which constrains them to
alter their former systems of government. The history of the
present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries
and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment
of an absolute tyranny over these States. To prove this, let
facts be submitted to a candid world:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and
necessary for the public good.</p>

<p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass laws of immediate
and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation
till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he
has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>

<p>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of
large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish
the right of representation in the legislature; a right inestimable
to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public
records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance
with his measures.</p>

<p>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing,
with manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the
people.</p>

<p>He has refused, for a long time after such dissolution, to
cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers,
incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large
for their exercise; the State remaining, in the meantime,
exposed to all the danger of invasion from without, and convulsions
within.</p>

<p>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States;
for that purpose, obstructing the laws for naturalization of
foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration
hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations
of lands.</p>

<p>He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing
his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.</p>

<p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the
tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their
salaries.</p>

<p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither
swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies,
without the consent of our legislature.</p>

<p>He has affected to render the military independent of, and
superior to, the civil power.</p>

<p>He has combined with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction
foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;
giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.</p>

<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

<p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for
any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of
these States:</p>

<p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p>For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</p>

<p>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by
jury:</p>

<p>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended
offenses:</p>

<p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring
province, establishing therein an arbitrary government,
and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an
example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute
rule into these colonies:</p>

<p>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable
laws, and altering fundamentally, the powers of our government:</p>

<p>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves
invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of
his protection, and waging war against us.</p>

<p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our
towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p>He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries
to complete the work of death, desolation, and tyranny,
already begun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy
scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally
unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the
high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the
executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves
by their hands.</p>

<p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has
endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the
merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an
undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.</p>

<p>In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for
redress, in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have
been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose
character is thus marked by every act which may define a
tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British
brethren. We have warned them from time to time, of
attempts made by their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable
jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the
circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We
have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we
have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to
disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt
our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been
deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We must,
therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation,
and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,
enemies in war, in peace, friends.</p>

<p>We, therefore, the representatives of the UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS assembled,
appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude
of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority
of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and
declare: That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to
be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are
absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all
political connection between them and the State of Great
Britain, is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have full
power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish
commerce, and to do all other acts and things which INDEPENDENT
STATES may of right do. And, for the support
of this declaration, and in a firm reliance on the protection of
DIVINE PROVIDENCE, we mutually pledge to each other
our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.</p>

<span class="smaller">ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION AND PERPETUAL
UNION BETWEEN THE STATES.</span></h3>

<p><i>To all whom these Presents shall come, We, the undersigned
Delegates of the States affixed to our names, send greeting</i>—Whereas,
the Delegates of the United States of America, in
Congress assembled, did, on the 15th day of November, in the
year of our Lord 1777, and in the Second Year of the Independence
of America, agree to certain Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union between the States of New Hampshire,
Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence
Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Georgia, in the words following, viz.:</p>

<p><i>Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between
the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay,
Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
and Georgia.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 1.</span> The style of this Confederacy shall be “The
United States of America.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom, and
independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which
is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United
States in Congress assembled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> The said States hereby severally enter into a firm
league of friendship with each other, for their common defense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general
welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all
force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on
account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense
whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 4.</span> The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship
and intercourse among the people of the different States
in this Union, the free inhabitants of each of these States—paupers,
vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted—shall
be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in
the several States; and the people of each State shall have free
ingress and egress to and from any other State, and shall enjoy
therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the
same duties, impositions, and restrictions, as the inhabitants
thereof respectively, provided that such restriction shall not
extend so far as to prevent the removal of property, imported
into any State, to any other State of which the owner is an
inhabitant; provided, also, that no imposition, duties, or restriction
shall be laid by any State on the property of the United
States, or either of them.</p>

<p>If any person guilty of or charged with treason, felony, or
other high misdemeanor in any State, shall flee from justice,
and be found in any of the United States, he shall, upon demand
of the Governor, or executive power of the State from which
he fled, be delivered up and removed to the State having jurisdiction
of his offense.</p>

<p>Full faith and credit shall be given in each of these States,
to the records, acts, and judicial proceedings of the courts and
magistrates of every other State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span> For the more convenient management of the general
interest of the United States, Delegates shall be annually
appointed, in such manner as the legislature of each State shall
direct, to meet in Congress on the first Monday in November,
in every year, with a power reserved to each State, to recall its
Delegates, or any of them, at any time within the year, and to
send others in their stead, for the remainder of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>No State shall be represented in Congress by less than
two, nor more than seven members; and no person shall be
capable of being a Delegate for more than three years in any
term of six years; nor shall any person, being a Delegate, be
capable of holding any office under the United States, for which
he, or another for his benefit, receives any salary, fees or
emolument of any kind.</p>

<p>Each State shall maintain its own Delegates in any meeting
of the States, and while they act as members of the Committee
of the States.</p>

<p>In determining questions in the United States in Congress
assembled, each State shall have one vote.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech and debate in Congress shall not be
impeached or questioned in any court or place, out of Congress,
and the members of Congress shall be protected in their persons
from arrests and imprisonments, during the time of their
going to and from, and attendance on Congress, except for
treason, felony, or breach of the peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span> No State, without the consent of the United States
in Congress assembled, shall send an embassy to, or receive an
embassy from, or enter into any conference, agreement, alliance,
or treaty with any King, Prince, or State; nor shall any person
holding any office of profit or trust under the United States,
or any of them, accept of any present, emolument, office, or
title of any kind whatever from any King, Prince, or Foreign
State; nor shall the United States in Congress assembled, or
any of them, grant any title of nobility.</p>

<p>No two or more States shall enter into any treaty, confederation,
or alliance whatever between them, without the consent
of the United States in Congress assembled, specifying accurately
the purposes for which the same is to be entered into,
and how long it shall continue.</p>

<p>No State shall lay any imposts or duties which may interfere
with any stipulation in treaties, entered into by the United
States in Congress assembled, with any King, Prince, or State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in pursuance of any treaties already proposed by Congress, to
the Courts of France and Spain.</p>

<p>No vessels of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any
State except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary
by the United States in Congress assembled, for the defense of
such State, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept
up by any State in time of peace, except such number only, as
in the judgment of the United States in Congress assembled,
shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the
defense of such State; but every State shall always keep up a well
regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutred,
and shall provide and have constantly ready for use, in
public stores, a due number of field-pieces and tents, and a
proper quantity of arms, ammunition, and camp equipage.</p>

<p>No State shall engage in any war without the consent of the
United States in Congress assembled, unless such State be actually
invaded by enemies, or shall have received certain advice
of a resolution being formed by some nation of Indians to
invade such a State, and the danger is so imminent as not to
admit of a delay, till the United States in Congress assembled
can be consulted; nor shall any State grant commissions to any
ships or vessels of war, nor letters of marque or reprisal, except
it be after a declaration of war by the United States in
Congress assembled, and then only against the Kingdom or
State, and the subjects thereof, against which war has been so
declared, and under such regulations as shall be established by
the United States in Congress assembled, unless such State be
infested by pirates, in which case vessels of war may be fitted
out for that occasion, and kept so long as the danger shall continue,
or until the United States in Congress assembled shall
determine otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span> When land forces are raised by any State for the
common defense, all officers of, or under the rank of colonel,
shall be appointed by the legislature of each State respectively,
by whom such forces shall be raised, or in such manner as such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
State shall direct, and all vacancies shall be filled up by the
State which first made the appointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 8.</span> All charges of war, and all other expenses that
shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare,
and allowed by the United States in Congress assembled, shall
be defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied
by the several States, in proportion to the value of all land
within each State, granted to or surveyed for any person, as
such land and the buildings and improvements thereon shall be
estimated according to such mode as the United States in Congress
assembled shall, from time to time, direct and appoint.
The taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied
by the authority and direction of the legislatures of the several
States, within the time agreed upon by the United States in
Congress assembled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 9.</span> The United States in Congress assembled shall
have the sole and exclusive right and power of determining
on peace and war, except in the cases mentioned in the sixth
article—of sending and receiving ambassadors—entering into
treaties and alliances: provided that no treaty of commerce
shall be made whereby the legislative power of the respective
States shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and
duties on foreigners as their own people are subjected to, or from
prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of
goods or commodities whatsoever—of establishing rules for
deciding in all cases what captures on land or water shall be
legal, and in what manner prizes taken by land or naval forces
in the service of the United States shall be divided or appropriated—of
granting letters of marque and reprisal in times
of peace—appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies
committed on the high seas, and establishing courts for receiving
and determining finally appeals in all cases of captures,
provided that no member of Congress shall be appointed a
judge of any of the said courts.</p>

<p>The United States in Congress assembled shall also be the
last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
or that hereafter may arise, between two or more States
concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever,
which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following:
Whenever the legislative or executive authority or
lawful agent of any State in controversy with another shall
present a petition to Congress, stating the matter in question,
and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall be given by
order of Congress, to the legislative or executive authority of
the other State in controversy, and a day assigned for the
appearance of the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then
be directed to appoint, by joint consent, commissioners or
judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the
matter in question; but if they cannot agree, Congress shall
name three persons out of each of the United States, and from
the list of such persons each party shall alternately strike out
one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced
to thirteen, and from that number not less than seven nor more
than nine names, as Congress shall direct, shall, in the presence
of Congress, be drawn out by lot, and the persons whose names
shall be so drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners
or judges to hear and finally determine the controversy, so
always as a major part of the judges who shall hear the cause
shall agree in the determination; and if either party shall
neglect to attend at the day appointed, without showing reasons
which Congress shall judge sufficient, or, being present,
shall refuse to strike, the Congress shall proceed to nominate
three persons out of each State, and the Secretary of Congress
shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and
the judgment and sentence of the court to be appointed, in
the manner above prescribed, shall be final and conclusive;
and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority
of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or cause, the
court shall, nevertheless, proceed to pronounce sentence or
judgment, which shall in like manner be final and decisive,
the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either
case transmitted to Congress and lodged among the acts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Congress for the security of the parties concerned: provided
that every commissioner, before he sits in judgment, shall take
an oath, to be administered by one of the judges of the Supreme
or Superior Court of the State where the cause shall be
tried, “well and truly to hear and determine the matter in
question, according to the best of his judgment, without favor,
affection, or hope of reward:” provided also that no State shall
be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States.</p>

<p>All controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed
under different grants of two or more States, whose jurisdictions,
as they may respect such lands and the States which
passed such grants, are adjusted, the said grants, or either of
them, being at the same time claimed to have originated antecedent
to such settlement of jurisdiction, shall, on the petition
of either party to the Congress of the United States, be finally
determined, as near as may be, in the same manner as is before
prescribed for deciding disputes respecting territorial jurisdiction
between different States.</p>

<p>The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the
sole exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value
of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective
States; fixing the standard of weights and measures
throughout the United States; regulating the trade and managing
all affairs with the Indians not members of any of
the States—provided that the legislative right of any State
within its own limits be not infringed or violated; establishing
or regulating post offices from one State to another, throughout
all the United States, and exacting such postage on the papers
passing through the same as may be requisite to defray the
expenses of the said office; appointing all officers of the land
forces in the service of the United States, except regimental
officers; appointing all the officers of the naval forces, and
commissioning all officers whatever in the service of the United
States; making rules for the government and regulation of the
said land and naval forces, and directing their operations.</p>

<p>The United States in Congress assembled shall have authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to appoint a committee to sit in the recess of Congress, to
be denominated “A Committee of the States,” and to consist
of one delegate from each State, and to appoint such other
committees and civil officers as may be necessary for managing
the general affairs of the United States under their direction;
to appoint one of their number to preside—provided that no
person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than
one year in any term of three years; to ascertain the necessary
sums of money to be raised for the service of the United
States, and to appropriate and apply the same for defraying the
public expenses; to borrow money or emit bills on the credit
of the United States, transmitting every half year to the respective
States an account of the sums of money so borrowed or
emitted; to build and equip a navy; to agree upon the number

such extra number shall be raised, officered, clothed, armed

unless the legislature of such State shall judge that such extra
number cannot be safely spared out of the same, in which case
they shall raise, officer, clothe, arm and equip as many of such

<span class="smaller">THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR FROM 1776 TO 1783.</span></h3>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">July 4—</span>The British troops had been driven from Boston about
the middle of March. From that time to the last of
June no British soldiers had a foothold anywhere in
the thirteen colonies. England had been preparing,
however. The aid of German troops had been
secured, and an expedition made ready. It was a fortunate
respite, after a great success, and finding the
mother country inexorable in her determination, in
which to carefully consider the situation. That consideration
had produced that noble protest of freemen
against tyranny—The Declaration of Independence.
It now remained to make it good by force of arms
against a rich and powerful European empire, which
was summoning its energies to the work of subjugation.
On the 28th of June General Howe landed the
late garrison of Boston, and other troops, on Staten
Island.</p>

<p><span class="date">July 12—</span>Lord Howe arrived from England; Gen. Clinton
returned from his repulse at Fort Moultrie, several
Hessian regiments soon after arrived, and the British
force amounted to 24,000; Gen. Carleton was near
Lake Champlain with 13,000 men. The forces under
Washington did not amount to half as many, but the
British had a salutary respect for American prowess,
and were laboring to win the American leaders back
by promises of pardon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="date">Aug. 27—</span>The battle of Long Island. The Americans, 9,000
strong, are attacked by the British, 15,000 strong.
The Americans are worsted, but hold their intrenched
camp. Washington silently and safely retreats during
the night. The Americans lost 1,600 in killed,
wounded and prisoners. British killed and wounded,
400.</p>

<p><span class="date">Sept. 1—</span>General Howe sends General Sullivan (American,
taken prisoner in the late battle), to Congress to discuss
a compromise of the dispute between England
and the Colonies. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams,
and Edward Rutledge, are appointed to meet English
commissioners. They meet on Staten Island, but can
make no arrangements.</p>

<p><span class="date">Sept. 15—</span>British army takes possession of New York. General
Washington’s army being largely made up of
militia, which come and go, he adopts “The Fabian
Policy” of avoiding general engagements, keeping
the enemy harrassed and in constant movement.
This saved the American cause.</p>

<p><span class="date">Sept. 26—</span>Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee
appointed commissioners to France.</p>

<p><span class="date">Nov. 1—</span>Henry Laurens, of South Carolina, chosen President
of Congress.</p>

<p><span class="date">Nov. 16—</span>Fort Washington, at the north end of Manhattan
Island, assaulted by the British, in force. The fort
was taken with 2,000 prisoners. The British loss was
1,200 in killed and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="date">Nov. 18—</span>Americans evacuate Fort Lee, on the Hudson, above
New York.</p>

<p><span class="date">Nov. 28—</span>Washington retreats across the Delaware into Pennsylvania.</p>

and is taken prisoner by the British.</p>

Rhode Island.</p>

in New Jersey, Congress adjourns from Philadelphia
to Baltimore.</p>

<p><span class="date">Dec. 26-27—</span>Washington suddenly crosses the Delaware and
surprises Trenton. He captures 1,000 Hessians and
six cannon, with a loss of four killed. In this year
about 350 British merchant vessels had been taken
by Americans.</p>

who lands on Long Island with 200 men,
destroys twelve vessels, large quantities of provision
and forage, takes ninety prisoners, and retreats without
the loss of a man.</p>

<p><span class="date">May 27—</span>Button Gwinnett, of Georgia, one of the signers of
the Declaration of Independence, is killed in a duel.</p>

<p><span class="date">June 22—</span>Gen. Howe evacuates New Brunswick, New Jersey,
and retires in order to draw Washington into a
battle. Washington advances till he penetrates the
design of the enemy, when he retreats to a strong
position and foils the British.</p>

<p><span class="date">June 30—</span>General Howe embarks 16,000 troops at Staten
Island for Philadelphia. About this time the French
Marquis De Lafayette, a youth of nineteen, arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in America, with twelve other foreign officers, to aid

four cannon. American loss fourteen killed and
forty-two wounded. This turned the tide against
Burgoyne.</p>

Washington retreats in good order.</p>

Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 19—</span>Battle of Stillwater between Gates, American, and

<p><span class="date">” 7—</span>Battle of Saratoga. Burgoyne is defeated, and part
of his camp with stores and ammunition, much
needed by the Americans, captured. British loss 400.
They retreated in the night.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 15—</span>Kingston, New York, burned by the British. They
had taken forts Clinton and Montgomery, defending
the river below, October 6th. This was an effort to
aid Burgoyne, but it failed, being too late, and they
retreated down the river.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 17—</span>Gen. Burgoyne surrenders his whole army to
Gen. Gates. The prisoners amounted to 5,647.
Burgoyne had lost about 4,000 since his capture of
Ticonderoga. Thirty-five brass field-pieces and 5,000
stand of arms fell into the hands of the Americans.
Washington, as commander-in-chief, had diminished
his own army till it was much inferior to the British
he was facing, to secure the success of the northern
army against Burgoyne. This was the turning point
of the war. Its immediate result was a treaty of
alliance with France.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 22—</span>Count Donop, with 1,200 Hessians, attacks the American
fort at Red Bank, below Philadelphia, and is

at Valley Forge. During this year American prisoners
were treated with great cruelty at New York.
General Gates, who had really succeeded in capturing
Burgoyne only by the aid of Generals Schuyler and
Arnold, intrigues against Washington. When this
became known the general indignation killed the
scheme.</p>

</div>

<h4>1778.</h4>

<p>The American cause was really gained by the war of the previous
year. The Americans were so far unanimous, and so
spirited, that the British had not been able to get a permanent
hold on any part of the country, save what was occupied
by their armies in force.</p>

Governor Johnstone, to treat for peace with the
colonies, on the basis of granting everything they
had asked, except independence, Congress replies,
refusing all intercourse unless the independence of
the States were first recognized, and the English army
withdrawn. Two years before, this would have been
eagerly accepted. England had lost, at the beginning
of this year, twenty thousand men, and 550 vessels,
taken by American cruisers, worth twelve million
dollars, and had spent one hundred million dollars
on military armaments in America.</p>

<h4>1782.</h4>

<p>The war was now practically concluded. The finances of
the United States, the sad condition of which had so much
interfered with the collection and support of strong and well-disciplined
armies, had been lately supported by loans from
France and Holland. The Americans were stronger than ever,
the British could not hold possession even of the Southern
States, where there were more royalist inhabitants than further
north; and the aid of France on the sea really made the
Americans invincible. England could no longer raise the
money or the troops to continue the struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The year 1782 was mostly spent in negotiations. The difficulties

of the new Government were a subject of much dispute.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787.</span></h3>

<p>The successful termination of the Revolutionary War of
seven years made the United Colonies which had commenced
it, in fact, as well as in their Declaration, Free and Independent
States. Toward the close of the war they had adopted
Articles of Confederation. These were soon found to be inadequate
to secure the general welfare, and without sufficient
authority to carry their measures into effect. No sufficient
means were supplied by them to maintain the public credit,
and all the interests of the country languished.</p>

<p>They formed the Bond of Union for six years or more, and
served an excellent purpose in calling the attention of statesmen
and the people to the points most important in the constitution
of a vigorous government. It was the trial essay, and
the intelligence of the leading men of that period turned it to
great profit.</p>

<p>In 1786 the legislature of Virginia proposed a convention of
commissioners to improve the condition of trade and commerce.
These commissioners met and recommended Congress to call a
General Convention to revise the Articles of Confederation.
This convention assembled in May, 1787, in Philadelphia; all
the States except Rhode Island being represented. George
Washington was chosen president. The members of this convention
were the representatives of a people who had proved
their firmness and attachment to liberty during a long war and
against great difficulties. The delegates were men of tried
patriotism, and the event has proved their wise and discriminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
foresight. The system of government they planned is
their most eloquent eulogy. The severe tests to which the
expansion of the nation and the conflicts of sections and interests
have subjected it, have served only the more fully to reveal
how perfectly they comprehended the principles of a republican
government, and their singular skill in arrangement. They
combined the utmost vigor with the greatest security of rights.
It is a glorious monument to their political insight. They,
themselves, were not aware how profound was the wisdom, how
complete the adaptation of its provisions. They signed it with
many misgivings, on the 17th of September, 1787, after four
months of diligent labor. It was then presented to the people
for their ratification. They were cautious and prudent in
those times, and could not appreciate as we do now, the extreme
value of the work that had been accomplished. Time was
required to bring out its excellences, and show how few and
comparatively unimportant were its defects. It was examined
with careful attention, and finally adopted as follows:</p>

<p>As shown above, two years passed before it was finally ratified
by all the States. Both the delay and the final unanimity
in its acceptance, giving testimony to the prudence and thoughtfulness
of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Electors of President and Vice-President were chosen in the
winter of 1788-1789. March 4th had been appointed as the
time for the government to go into operation, but a delay in
assembling the members of Congress deferred the inauguration
of Washington, as first President, until April 30th. Congress
immediately organized the new government, and, in conjunction
with the President, appointed the necessary officers.
Some minor provisions were added or changed by the first Congress
in the manner provided by the Constitution itself, that
is, by a two-thirds vote in both Houses, and ratification by
three-fourths of the States.</p>

<p>Ten amendments were made at this time. The eleventh
amendment was added in 1794. The twelfth in 1803. The
thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments have been
added since 1863.</p>

<p>A resolution to amend is passed by the requisite majorities
in both Houses, sent to the legislatures of the States, and,
when three-fourths of them have approved it, the Secretary of
State causes the resolution and amendment to be published in
all the States and Territories, and it becomes valid as part of
the Constitution.</p>

<p>Containing the wisest provisions of English law, it rejects
all that is not in harmony with our circumstances, and our fundamental
doctrine that all men have equal rights to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness. This it keeps continually
in view, and, by the sense of dignity and worth which it tends
to promote in the humblest man, gradually educates him up to
the standard necessary for a free citizen, and, by its respect for
the rights of all, tends to induce in each the same disposition.</p>

<p>The wisest men of the Republic, by infusing into this document
their own self-respect, and respect for others, gave tone
and direction to all the future. Their own <i>characters</i> were so
far imparted to their work as to exert a salutary influence on
the destiny of the people whose fundamental law they compiled.</p>

<p>This document is the law of the land, obliging the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to obedience, to justice, and right, and raising the lowest to an
equal share in its political privileges, and to its vigorous protection.
Consequently a steady improvement in these respects
has marked the growth of the country, and the benign influence
of this respect for <i>man</i> and his <i>rights</i> has gone forth from
the American Republic as a Regenerator among the nations of
the earth.</p>

<h4>CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, AND ITS AMENDMENTS.</h4>

<p>We, the People of the United States, in order to form a more
perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,
provide for the common defense, promote the general
welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity, do ordain and establish this <span class="smcap">Constitution</span>
for the United States of America.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Article I.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> All legislative powers herein granted shall be
vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist
of a Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> The House of Representatives shall be composed
of members chosen every second year by the people of the
several States, and the electors in each State shall have the
qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous
branch of the State Legislature.</p>

<p>No person shall be a Representative who shall not have
attained to the age of twenty-five years, and been seven years
a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected,
be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p>Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among
the several States which may be included within this Union,
according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined
by adding to the whole number of free persons, including
those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding
Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons. The actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
enumeration shall be made within three years after the first
meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within
every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall
by law direct. The number of Representatives shall not exceed
one for every thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least
one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made
the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three,
Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations
one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania
eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North
Carolina five, and Georgia three.</p>

<p>When vacancies happen in the representation from any State,
the Executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to
fill such vacancies.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and
other officers, and shall have the sole power of impeachment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> The Senate of the United States shall be composed
of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature
thereof for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.</p>

<p>Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence
of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be
into three classes. The seats of the Senators of the first class
shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of the
second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and of the
third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one-third
may be chosen every second year; and if vacancies happen by
resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the Legislature
of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary appointments
until the next meeting of the Legislature, which
shall then fill such vacancies.</p>

<p>No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to
the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the
United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant
of that State for which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p>The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of
the Senate, but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a President
<i>pro tempore</i>, in the absence of the Vice-President, or
when he shall exercise the office of President of the United
States.</p>

<p>The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.
When sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation.
When the President of the United States is tried, the
Chief Justice shall preside. And no person shall be convicted
without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
present.</p>

<p>Judgment, in cases of impeachment, shall not extend further
than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United
States; but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and
subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according
to law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> The times, places, and manner of holding elections
for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each
State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any
time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the
places of choosing Senators.</p>

<p>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and
such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless
they shall by law appoint a different day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> Each house shall be the judge of the election,
returns, and qualifications of its own members, and a majority
of each shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller
number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized
to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner
and under such penalties as each house may provide.</p>

<p>Each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish
its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence
of two-thirds, expel a member.</p>

<p>Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from
time to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in
their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
members of either house on any question shall, at the desire
of one-fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.</p>

<p>Neither house, during the session of Congress, shall, without
the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days,
nor to any other place than that in which the two houses shall
be sitting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> The Senators and Representatives shall receive a
compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and
paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in
all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be
privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session
of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from
the same; and for any speech or debate in either House they
shall not be questioned in any other place.</p>

<p>No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for
which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the
authority of the United States, which shall have been created,
or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during
such time; and no person holding any office under the United
States, shall be a member of either house during his continuance
in office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the
House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur
with amendments as on other bills.</p>

<p>Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented
to the President of the United States; if he approve he
shall sign it; but if not, he shall return it, with his objections,
to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter
the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider
it. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of that House
shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the
objection, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be
reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it
shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both
Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered
on the journal of each House respectively. If any bill shall
not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays
excepted), after it shall have been presented to him, the same
shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the
Congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return, in which
case it shall not be a law.</p>

<p>Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of
the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary
(except on a question of adjournment), shall be presented to the
President of the United States, and before the same shall take
effect shall be approved by him, or, being disapproved by him,
shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of
Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed
in the case of a bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 8.</span> The Congress shall have power—</p>

<p>To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay
the debts and provide for the common defense and general
welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts, and excises
shall be uniform throughout the United States;</p>

of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed
by Congress.</p>

<p>To exercise legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district
(not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of
particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the
seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise

make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of
votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit
sealed to the seat of the government of the United States,
directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the
Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives,
open all the certificates, and the votes shall then
be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes
shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the
whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more
than one who have such majority, and have an equal number
of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately
choose by ballot one of them for President; and if no person
have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said
House shall in like manner choose the President. But in
choosing the President, the vote shall be taken by States, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
representation from each State having one vote; a quorum for
this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds
of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be
necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the
President, the person having the greatest number of votes of the
electors shall be the Vice-President. But if there should
remain two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall
choose from them by ballot the Vice-President.]<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The
Judges, both of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their
offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive
for their services a compensation, which shall not be diminished
during their continuance in office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law

Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court
shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with
such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress
shall make.</p>

<p>The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall
be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the
said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed
within any State, the trial shall be at such place or
places as the Congress may by law have directed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> Treason against the United States shall consist only

giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same
overt act, or on confession in open court.</p>

<p>The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of
treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of
blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person
attainted.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Article IV.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> Full faith and credit shall be given in each
State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of
every other State. And the Congress may, by general laws,
prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings
shall be proved, and the effect thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all
privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.</p>

<p>A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or other
crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another
State, shall, on demand of the Executive authority of the State
from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State
having jurisdiction of the crime.</p>

<p>No person held to service or labor in one State, under the
laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of
any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service
or labor, but shall be delivered up on the claim of the party to
whom such service or labor may be due.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> New States may be admitted by the Congress
into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected
within the jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be
formed by the junction of two or more States, or parts of
States, without the consent of the Legislatures of the States
concerned, as well as of the Congress.</p>

<p>The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all
needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other
property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this
Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims
of the United States, or of any particular State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> The United States shall guarantee to every State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
in this Union a Republican form of government, and shall
protect each of them against invasion, and on application of
the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot
be convened), against domestic violence.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Article V.</span></h5>

<p>The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall
deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution,
or, on the application of the Legislatures of two-thirds
of the several States, shall call a convention for proposing
amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents
and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by
the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, or by
conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other
mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress. Provided
that no amendment which may be made prior to the year
one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner
affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the
first article; and that no State, without its consent, shall be
deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Article VI.</span></h5>

<p>All debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before
the adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the
United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.</p>

<p>This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which
shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or
which shall be made, under the authority of the United States,
shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every
State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the
members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive
and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several
States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this
Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>

other crimes, the basis of representation therein shall be
reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens
shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one

any office, civil or military, under the United States or under
any State, who, having previously taken an oath as a Member of

had been adopted by a convention and ratified by the requisite
number of States, went into operation.</p>

<h2 id="PART_SECOND">PART SECOND.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.</span></h2>

<p>The plan of this part of our work requires us to give a complete
view of the government of the United States, and in such
detail as to be adequate to all the purposes of the citizen and
the student who wish to understand its structure and modes of
working. It will be found, we think, a clear, concise, and
complete account of what it is indispensable to the American
to know.</p>

<p>There are three branches, each independent, having its sphere
of general action entirely distinct, and clearly defined by the
Constitution; yet working in harmony with the others, and
locking in, so to speak, with them at special points, like the
cogs of a system of wheels. The adjustment was more perfect
than the authors of the Constitution themselves believed;
probably because the spirit of the whole was in harmony with
the people whose interests it was designed to guard.</p>

<p>These three branches are the Legislative, the Executive, and
the Judicial. All the institutions or general subdivisions of
each are given in connection, with such explanations and data
as they seem to require. We commence with the Executive,
as being most immediately in contact with the people at large,
having a wider field, and a larger number of distinct organizations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and agents. This branch exhausted, we present the Legislative,
and finally the Judicial, closing with such matters as
belong to the government as a whole.</p>

<p>No human government is perfect, neither can exact and
equal justice be done in every case by human laws. But the
scope and design of our legislation and jurisprudence is to dispense
justice to all, to place all on an equality before the laws,
and to give the same rights to the rich and to the poor. No
privileged class is known to our laws, and the lowest may
aspire to the highest places of distinction and honor; many
have done so, and have reached the most exalted positions.
The fullest religious liberty is granted to all; every man may
worship as he pleases, when and where he pleases, without
molestation or fear. He is not, as in many other countries,
taxed to support a church established by law. He may pay
for religious purposes as much or as little as he pleases, and to
any church he prefers, or he may pay nothing, and no one can
call him to account or use any compulsion whatever in this
matter.</p>

<p>Every citizen has a vote for the choice of his rulers, and
through his representatives a voice in making the laws by
which he is governed.</p>

<p>As to his business or calling, he may do that which best
suits his interests or his tastes. He may go when or where he
desires, he may stay in the country or leave it without restraint
or hindrance; in short, he may do whatsoever seemeth good to
him, provided he does not infringe on the rights of others.</p>

<p>To this liberty, to these equal rights, privileges, and advantages
do we attribute our rapid growth and power. The advantages
and benefits of so wise, so liberal, and so beneficent a government
are not unknown to the people of other countries where
they do not enjoy so much freedom; and this accounts for the
wonderful immigration to the United States from nearly every
country in Europe. This flow has continued for more than
three-quarters of a century, and is still unabated. It has
added many millions to the natural increase of our population,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
while very few of our own people ever leave their own country
with the hope of bettering their condition, or of finding a government
under which they can enjoy more liberty or better
protection. To gain a clearer conception of the intimate connection
between a good government and the prosperity of the
country, let us, for example, place Mexico in contrast with the
United States. Mexico was settled long before the United
States, and in climate and mineral wealth has the advantage of
us; yet the ever unsettled condition of its government, together
with intolerance of any but the Catholic religion, has prevented
any increase of population or any advancement in anything
which gives a nation respectability, greatness, or power.</p>

<p>Let us draw another contrast by considering Ireland. An
oppressive government has diminished the population, prevented
any advancement, and impoverished the country. We
might draw many such contrasts between the United States and
other countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America,
which would convince any one who has the power to trace
causes to effects, and effects to causes, that a just and liberal
government is an essential condition upon which the prosperity
of any country depends.</p>

<h3 id="THE_EXECUTIVE_DEPARTMENT">THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.</h3>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PRESIDENT.</span></h4>

<p>1. Congress legislates, or enacts laws; the officers of the
Supreme Court decide whether those laws are in conformity
with the Constitution; but the real ruler, the actual possessor
of power, is the President. In the language of the first section
of the second article of the Constitution, “The executive
powers of the government shall be vested in a President of the
United States of America.” The other branches of the government
decide <i>what</i> is to be done, and what is constitutionally
legal, and the President is the agent. He executes, or puts
in actual operation, the measures determined on by them.
Should he attempt to do anything not so prescribed, or to do
anything in an improper manner, contrary to or different from
the manner prescribed by the law, he may be impeached and
removed, and all the subordinate officers and agents of the government
released from the obligation to obey him.</p>

<p>2. The other branches are composed of many persons. He
has no associate. The execution of the law requires vigor and
decision, such as can be found only in a single mind and will.
All history shows that there is constant danger of power being
misused, whether one, two, or any number of men are the
depositaries of it; but one man is much better than two or
more, when vigor and promptness are required. All the securities
and checks that could be applied without embarrassing
his necessary freedom of action have been provided. They can
not, indeed, supply the want of judgment and uprightness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
so no absolute security against mismanagement can exist; but
the danger may be in large part avoided by carefulness in the
selection of the man who is to wield the whole power of a great
nation.</p>

<p>It is an office of great dignity, responsibility, and power, and
requires a man of great ability and probity to properly fill it.</p>

<p>3. The President is elected for four years, and may be reëlected
if the people see fit. Several times in our history the
President has been once reëlected, and so held the office for
eight years; but none have been twice reëlected, though there
is no law against it. The term commences and terminates on
the fourth day of March. He is elected by the people, every
voter having an equal influence in the choice; but it is not
done by voting for him directly, but by voting first for men
called electors, who cast their votes according to the wish of the
people. This system we shall hereafter examine.</p>

<p>4. A Vice-President is elected at the same time and in the
same way, who, in case of the President’s death, removal, resignation,
or inability to discharge the duties of his office, becomes
acting President during the remainder of his term, or while the
disability continues. The first Congress passed a law giving the
President a salary of $25,000 per annum, with the use of a
furnished house, and it remained the same until 1873, when it
was raised to $50,000 per year. He is forbidden by the Constitution
to receive any other public income during his term of
office, nor is he at liberty to accept presents from any foreign
power.</p>

<p>Before entering on the duties of his office he is required to
take an oath “to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution
of the United States,” to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>5. It is required that he shall be a native-born citizen of
the United States, that he shall have been fourteen years a
resident in the United States, and that he shall not be less than
thirty-five years of age; which are designed to insure his attachment
to American interests, his thorough acquaintance with
American affairs, and the full maturity of his mind and character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>6. It is his duty to appoint such officers in every department
of the public service as are not otherwise provided for. He
usually sends the nomination to the Senate for their approval
or consent, and when that is given appoints them by commission,
signed with his name, to the office. In this manner he
nominates the Justices of the Supreme Court, ambassadors,
resident ministers, chargé-d’affaires, consuls, and other representatives
of the government abroad, all the Heads of Executive
Departments, and the more important subordinate officers of
each department. When the Senate is not in session he may
appoint all these directly, to serve until it meets again. The
clerks and minor officers are usually appointed by Heads of
Departments. In all other cases the advice and consent of the
Senate are required before the appointment and commission
can be legal.</p>

<p>7. It is his duty to make treaties with Foreign Powers, but
these require confirmation by two-thirds of the Senate to be
valid. He receives the Representatives of Foreign Powers,
and superintends all diplomatic intercourse with them and with
our own Representatives abroad.</p>

<p>He is commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and must
sign the commissions of all the officers in each. He may grant
reprieves and pardons at his discretion, except in cases of impeachment,
and he is required to approve and sign the laws
passed by Congress before they can take effect. If he does
not approve a law he “vetoes” it by returning it to Congress,
with his reasons for not signing it. If that body reconsiders
it and reënacts it by a two-thirds vote of each house, it may
become a law without his signature.</p>

<p>8. He may call extra sessions of Congress for special reasons,
and may adjourn it in case of disagreement between the
two houses as to the time of adjournment. It is his duty to
give information to Congress, at the commencement of each
session, of the state of the country, and to recommend to it
such legislative enactments as he may judge are required. This
is called “The President’s Message,” and is looked for with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
much interest in this and in foreign countries, since his position
makes him intimately acquainted with every subject
relating to the public welfare. When he considers that the
occasion demands it, or when he is requested by Congress to
give information on a special point, he communicates with
them by similar documents, called messages.</p>

<p>He may be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high
crimes, by the House of Representatives, and tried by the
Senate, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding over
that body during the trial, and in case of conviction is removed
from office.</p>

<p>9. It will be seen that he possesses great power, and that
he is almost overwhelmed by responsibilities. The members
of his cabinet are his constitutional advisers, and share more
or less of this responsibility, although his will may override
them all if he so chooses.</p>

<p>There are many provisions for preventing an abuse of power
in the Constitution and in the laws of Congress, but all history
proves that nothing but watchfulness and wisdom on the part
of the people can preserve to them their rights and liberties.
Power, wherever lodged, is naturally aggressive. Fortunately
the people themselves in this country are the <i>source</i> of power,
and may legally restrain its exercise in their representatives
and executive officers, when it threatens to become excessive.</p>

<p>The following are the names of all the Presidents, from
Washington, the first, down to the present incumbent:</p>

<p>George Washington, Va., 30th April, 1789, to 4th March, 1797—seven

years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>John Quincy Adams, Mass., 4th March, 1825, to 4th March,
1829—four years.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson, Tenn., 4th March, 1829, to 4th March,
1837—eight years.</p>

<p>Martin Van Buren, N. Y., 4th March, 1837, to 4th March,
1841—four years.</p>

<p>William H. Harrison, O., 4th March, 1841, to 4th April,
1841—one month.</p>

<p>John Tyler, Va., 4th April, 1841, to 4th March, 1845—three
years and eleven months.</p>

<p>James K. Polk, Tenn., 4th March, 1845, to 4th March, 1849—four
years.</p>

<p>Zachary Taylor, La., 4th March, 1849, to 9th July, 1850—one
year four months and five days.</p>

<p>Millard Fillmore, N. Y., 9th July, 1850, to 4th March, 1853—two
years seven months and twenty-six days.</p>

<p>Franklin Pierce, N. H., 4th March, 1853, to 4th March,
1857—four years.</p>

<p>James Buchanan, Pa., 4th March, 1857, to 4th March, 1861—four
years.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln, Ill., 4th March, 1861, to 15th April,
1865—four years one month and ten days.</p>

<p>Andrew Johnson, Tenn., 15th April, 1865, to 4th March,
1869—three years ten months and twenty days.</p>

<p>Ulysses S. Grant, Ill., 4th March, 1869, to 4th March,
1877—eight years.</p>

<p>Of these William H. Harrison died 4th April, 1841, just one
month after his inauguration. On the death of Harrison, Tyler,
the Vice-President, became acting President. Taylor died 9th
July, 1850, and Fillmore, Vice-President, became acting President.
Lincoln was assassinated on the 14th April, 1865, one
month and ten days after he was inaugurated upon his second
term, and Andrew Johnson, the Vice-President, became acting
President—this being the third time that such an event has
occurred since the government went into operation.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE VICE-PRESIDENT.</span></h4>

<p>This officer is elected by the people at the same time, and in
the same manner, as the President, and for the same term.
He must be a native citizen of the United States, and thirty-five
years of age.</p>

<p>His high-sounding title would lead one who is but little
acquainted with our government to think that he stands next
to the President himself in dignity and power; that on his
shoulders rests a large amount of the duties and responsibilities
of the administration. Such, however, is not the case.
He is, in fact, nearer a cipher than any of the high officers of
State. He is merely the presiding officer of the Senate, with
not even the power to vote, except in case of a tie vote in that
body, when he may give the casting vote. It is only in case
of the death, resignation, impeachment, or disability of the
President to discharge his duties, that the Vice-President
becomes an officer of much power or dignity.</p>

<p>The following is a list of all the Vice-Presidents:</p>

<p>John Adams, Mass., April 30th, 1789, to March 4th, 1797—seven
years, ten months and four days.</p>

1801—four years.</p>

<p>Aaron Burr, N. Y., March 4th, 1801, to March 4th, 1805—four
years.</p>

<p>George Clinton, N. Y., March 4th, 1805, to April 30th,
1812—seven years, one month, and sixteen days.</p>

<p>Elbridge Gerry, Mass., March 4th, 1813, to November 23d,
1814—one year, seven months, and nineteen days.</p>

<p>Daniel D. Tompkins, N. Y., March 4th, 1817, to March
4th, 1825—eight years.</p>

<p>John C. Calhoun, S. C., March 4th, 1825 to March 4th,
1833—eight years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

1849—four years.</p>

<p>Millard Fillmore, N. Y., March 4th, 1849, to July 9th,
1850—one year and four months.</p>

years.</p>

<p>Henry Wilson, Mass., March 4th, 1873, to March 4th, 1877—four
years.</p>

<p>Of these, Clinton died April 20th, 1812; from which time
till March 4th, 1813, the Vice-Presidency was vacant.</p>

<p>Gerry died November 23d, 1814; from which time till March
4th, 1817, the Vice-Presidency was vacant.</p>

<p>Tyler became acting President upon the death of President
Harrison; and until March 4th, 1845, the Vice-Presidency was
vacant.</p>

<p>Fillmore became acting President upon the death of President
Taylor, July 9th, 1850; and until March 4th, 1853,
the Vice-Presidency was vacant.</p>

<p>King was elected with President Pierce, in 1852, but died
April 18th, 1853. He never took his seat, and the Vice-Presidency
was vacant till March 4th, 1857.</p>

<p>Johnson became acting President upon the death of President
Lincoln, April 15th, 1865, and the Vice-Presidency again

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CABINET.</span></h4>

<p>1. The members of the President’s Cabinet are seven in
number, viz.: Five Secretaries, at the head of their respective
departments, of State, Treasury, War, Navy, and Interior;
and the Postmaster General, and Attorney General. It is
through these departments and their various bureaus, officers,
agents, and clerks, that the President performs most of the
duties of his position, viz.: that of <i>executing</i>, or putting in
force, the laws of Congress. He must, therefore, necessarily
take them into his counsels, and arrange, by their assistance,
the conduct of public affairs. Each one has the affairs of his
department so thoroughly systematized that he can tell, with
a little examination, the means at his disposal for carrying
into effect any special measure; and precise records of the
whole state of the public service may, at all times, be found
in their offices.</p>

<p>2. They are also selected for their several positions from
among those regarded as the most eminent statesmen of the
country, and each is supposed to be specially adapted, by his
experience, acquirements, and capacity, for his special position,
as well as in harmony with the general policy adopted by the
President. They are, therefore, properly, and <i>ex officio</i> (by
virtue of their office), his advisers. No one else can tell as
well as they the condition of public affairs at any particular
time, nor, in consequence, give as good advice on any special
measure requiring such knowledge. Without their aid the
President would have few means of judging what was best, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
possible, to be done at any particular crisis. They furnish the
material for his decisions, and the instruments to execute them.
They are heads of the Executive Departments, and, together
with the President, who is the head of them all, bringing them
all into harmony, and under the control of a single purpose
and will, they are called the administration. They administer,
or carry on, the government.</p>

<p>3. In other countries these administrative heads are usually
called Ministers, probably because they <i>serve</i> the ruler—servant
being the original meaning of the term minister—and are commonly
chosen among the members of the legislative bodies—perhaps
because that brings the government into closer
sympathy with the legislators, and promotes harmony of
action; but with us, no member of the Cabinet can have a
seat in, or take any part in the proceedings of, Congress. Great
care was taken to keep the different branches of the government
distinct and independent of each other. Each branch,
and each subdivision, is kept separate, and confined to its own
range of duties, being united to the others only by its head,
so that confusion and conflict might be impossible.</p>

<p>4. Each sub-department reports at stated intervals to its
head, and he to the President, and through him to Congress;
and at the same time they present such suggestions and arguments
for legislation in regard to their several departments as
their knowledge, experience, and reflections may have convinced
them to be desirable. They are supposed to give their whole
time and thought to the care and improvement of their several
branches of the public service, and to be in condition to know
what further improvement should be provided for by law,
better than any one else.</p>

<p>5. Under Washington’s administration the departments and
members of Cabinet were but three—of State, of the Treasury,
and of War. In 1798, during the administration of John
Adams, the Department of the Navy was added, and its Secretary
took his seat in the Cabinet. It then had only four members
down to Jackson’s administration (1829 to 1837), when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Postmaster General was made a Cabinet officer, which increased
the number to five. During Mr. Tyler’s administration (1841-1845)
the Attorney General was made a member, and the
number was then six. At the close of Mr. Polk’s term as
President, in 1849, the Department of the Interior was created,
and its chief given the seventh seat in the Cabinet; since
which time there has been no increase. Congress may, at
their discretion, as the country grows, and the public service
with it, create other great or independent departments requiring
its representative to have a seat in the Cabinet, that the
state of the entire service may be readily known from the
officer most familiar with each branch.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">DEPARTMENT OF STATE.</span></h4>

<p>1. As the Chief Executive of a government cannot, for
want of time, attend to all the details of the business belonging
to his office, he, according to the usage of all times, appoints
various officers to attend to the different branches of public
business. In most countries these officers, who are next in
importance to the chief of the government, are called Ministers.
In accordance with the practice of using plain and
simple terms which was adopted in this country at the beginning,
they are called Secretaries. They are subordinates of the
President and supposed to act in his name and under his direction.</p>

<p>2. They are not specially named in the Constitution, but are
several times referred to as Heads of Departments, and thus it
was assumed that there would be such offices and officers, and
their appointment was provided for. The first Congress under
the Constitution organized these Executive Departments, the
President nominating and the Senate confirming the appointment
of the more responsible officers.</p>

<p>3. The first of these in rank is called the Department of
State, and its head is named the Secretary of State. He is, by
a law passed in 1853, aided by an Assistant Secretary, appointed
in the same manner as himself. The numerous under officers
required by the extensive business falling to this department
are appointed by the Secretary at its head.</p>

<p>4. This Department has charge of such business as may
arise between this government and the governments of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
countries. In most countries it is called the Department, or
Ministry, of Foreign Affairs, but the term Department of State
was preferred here. The great Seal of the United States is in his
keeping, and it is his duty to affix it to all civil commissions
given to officers of the United States who are appointed by the
President and Senate, or by the President alone. It is his duty,
under the supervision and control of the President, to conduct
the correspondence with, and give instructions to, the Foreign
Ministers, Consuls, and Agents of the government abroad,
to take charge of the official business and intercourse of the
government with the representatives of foreign governments
sent to us, and to attend to such other business arising from
our Foreign Relations as shall be committed to him by the
President.</p>

<p>5. It is his duty to keep in his office the original copies of
all acts, resolutions, and orders of Congress. He must deliver
to each Senator and Representative in Congress, and to the
Governor of each State, a printed copy of the same; and during
the session of each Congress he must publish the acts and resolutions
passed by it in one newspaper in the District of Columbia,
and in not more than two in each State and Territory of
the United States. He must also publish in like manner all
amendments of the Constitution, and all public treaties made
and ratified between the United States and any foreign State,
Prince, or Power, or with any of the Indian tribes.</p>

<p>6. And at the close of each session of Congress he must
cause to be published 11,000 copies in book form of all the laws,
etc., as before stated; and to distribute the same as directed by
law to the President and Vice-President, and to every ex-President;
to all the members of the Senate and House of Representatives;
to all the heads of the various departments and
bureaus; to all the Judges of the United States Courts, their
Clerks and Marshals; to all our Foreign Ministers, Consuls,
and Public Agents; in short, to all the important officers of
the government at home and abroad; in order that all who are
in government employ may know what the laws are, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
changes have been made in acts formerly existing. The
remaining copies are distributed to the States and Territories
according to the number of Representatives in Congress from
each of them.</p>

<p>7. It is also made the duty of the Secretary of State to give
passports to our own citizens who wish to travel in foreign
countries; to cause passports to be issued by such Diplomatic
or Consular officers of the United States as the President shall
direct; to give such information to our people through the
newspapers as he may from time to time receive from our Diplomatic
and Consular agents abroad, as he may deem important
to the nation, respecting our commercial interests in foreign
countries, and to prepare a form of passport for the ships
and vessels of the United States.</p>

<p>8. In the execution of extradition treaties between us and
foreign governments, it is lawful for the Secretary of State,
under his hand and seal of office, to issue an order for the rendition
of any person who has been found guilty of crime in a
foreign country, to any properly authorized person; that such
criminal may be taken out of the United States to the country
where the crime was committed.</p>

<p>9. It will be seen that, in addition to the duties connected
with our Foreign Relations, he is a kind of General Secretary
of the Legislative branch of the government, which probably
led to his being called Secretary of State rather than Secretary
of Foreign Affairs. The highest officer, in most other governments,
under the Executive, is commonly called Prime Minister;
but he usually has care of the general interests of the government,
internal as well as external, and the term would not be
fitting to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Our Foreign Relations require to be managed with great
wisdom and skill, since they often involve peace and war, and
the general prosperity of the country. It therefore requires a
man of great ability, and of extensive knowledge. He is a
member of the Cabinet, and one of the advisers or counselors
of the President. His appointment is for four years, or during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
a Presidential term; but he may be removed by the President
at any time, if he deems it advisable.</p>

<p>10. As a matter of historical reference, we append the
names of all the statesmen who have filled this high office,
commencing with the first, placing them in the order of the
dates of their appointments, together with the States from
which they came:</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN FOREIGN LANDS.</span></h4>

<p>1. Nations have business with each other, as individuals
have; and their governments employ agents to represent them
and transact business in their name. By these means their
political and commercial relations and intercourse are regulated,
treaties are made, and any disputes that may arise between
them settled. Officers of this character have been employed
from very early times, and by all nations. They are considered
to be clothed with the authority and dignity of the government
they represent, and therefore the office has ever been held
in great honor, and men most familiar with the affairs of their
own nation, of most extensive knowledge, prudence, and wisdom,
are supposed to be selected for so eminent a service.</p>

<p>2. By the law (or general consent) of nations ambassadors
are exempt from arrest, imprisonment, or prosecution. Any
interference with them in this way might hinder the execution
of the duties assigned them, and be a great damage to the
public welfare, and an offense of that kind committed against
them is considered as a dishonor to the government whose
agents they are. On the other hand they require much judgment
and tact that their conduct may not bring discredit on
their government. Their inviolable character is carried so
far as to exempt their servants from arrest, and their property
from seizure for debt. The law of Congress protecting the
Representatives of foreign governments to this country is but
a re-enactment, or acceptance, of what has been known as the
Law of Nations for many centuries all over the civilized world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
A violation of this established usage among nations, without
due atonement and satisfaction, would be recognized as a sufficient
cause for war against the nation so offending.</p>

<p>3. Our own foreign ministers of all grades are appointed by
the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
They are not, however, the representatives of the President,
but of the government of the United States. We said of all
grades, for there are grades of these officials, different in dignity
and power. They are distinguished also by different
names which indicate their rank, viz.: Ambassadors, Envoys
Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary, Ministers Resident,
and Chargé d’Affaires.</p>

<h5>AMBASSADORS.</h5>

<p>4. This title in our country has no very specific meaning.
It designates, however, a minister of the highest grade; but
does not distinguish between one who goes to reside in the
country whither he is sent, and one who is sent for some special
purpose; such as that of negotiating a treaty of peace, or
some other particular matter with which he is charged, and
when that is accomplished returns home. In the latter case
he is frequently styled a commissioner, because he was duly
authorized, and <i>commissioned</i> by his government to act for it;
but in both cases the officer is an ambassador, for that word
means a person authorized and sent to transact business for
his government.</p>

<h5>ENVOYS EXTRAORDINARY AND MINISTERS
PLENIPOTENTIARY.</h5>

<p>5. These titles designate ministers of the highest class;
but generally refer to such as go to reside in the country where
sent, and with full power to act for their government, in all
matters and things of a diplomatic character.</p>

<p>Where negotiations become necessary between the two
nations, permanent ministers of this grade are only sent to
great powers—governments of the higher class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h5>MINISTERS RESIDENT.</h5>

<p>6. These are not considered so high in rank as those termed
envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary. Yet they
are clothed with nearly the same powers, but are sent to countries
of less importance, and receive less salaries.</p>

<h5>COMMISSIONERS.</h5>

<p>7. There are a still lower grade of ministers (if we may
call them so), or government agents, who reside abroad. They
are sent to look after the interests of our government and its
citizens in places of not much importance, and where there is
but little to do. They also receive but small pay.</p>

<h5>CHARGE D’AFFAIRES.</h5>

<p>8. These officials rank as the lowest grade of ministers or
diplomatic officers, and are not clothed with much authority
or power, excepting when authorized to act in the room of a
minister of higher rank, whose place is for the time being
vacant. In this case consuls have been authorized to act in
place of ministers; but not unless authorized to do so by the
President of the United States.</p>

<h5>SECRETARIES OF LEGATION.</h5>

<p>9. Secretaries of Legation may with propriety be noticed
under the general head of ministers, although they are not
ministers of any grade, but are appointed by the same powers
that appoint ministers, and accompany them merely as their
secretaries. In the absence of a chargé d’affaires, they are
sometimes authorized to act in his place. The position is not
one of great dignity, nor is the compensation large.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">TREATIES—EXTRADITION TREATIES.</span></h4>

<p>1. A treaty is a written contract, entered into by two
nations, on some question of interest or intercourse between
them. It is precisely of the nature of a contract between two
persons when they bind themselves to do, or not to do, certain
things specified in the contract. That would be a treaty
between individuals. Treaties between nations are only different
in the solemn and formal manner of arranging and
confirming these agreements.</p>

<p>2. Treaties have often been of great service to the world,
both in ancient and modern times. By these negotiations,
wars have been prevented, friendly relations maintained, and
commercial intercourse kept up, advantageously to both parties.
Treaties may be negotiated by any persons properly authorized
by their governments to do so; and any government may
authorize such persons as they see fit, to perform these important
acts. In many cases the ordinary ministers who represent
their governments to other governments, negotiate ordinary
treaties. But in cases where something of an extraordinary
character is to be arranged, special ministers or commissioners
are sent for this express purpose. This was the case at the
treaty of Ghent (so called from the name of the place where
the commissioners met to arrange it), in 1814; by which a
peace was brought about between England and the United
States, after the last war between those powers. Special ministers,
or commissioners, as they were denominated, were
appointed and sent for this very purpose. A treaty of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
was agreed upon by the commissioners of the respective countries,
and hostilities ceased as soon as the news reached the
United States.</p>

<p>3. In some cases our government has authorized its commanding
generals to make a treaty with the hostile nation.
It has also given the same power to the commanders of our
national vessels; and also, in a few cases, to our consuls, in
countries at a great distance from home, such as China, Japan,
Siam, and Turkey.</p>

<p>The persons authorized to negotiate a treaty, rarely act without
instructions from their government, as to the times and
conditions of the proposed treaty. Much, however, must be
left to the sound judgment and discretion of the negotiators
as to the details.</p>

<p>4. It must be borne in mind that a treaty, although mutually
agreed upon by the agents of the nations concerned, is
not binding upon either party until properly ratified according
to the forms of the respective governments interested. The
modes of ratification differ in different governments. In ours
the Constitution confers this power upon the President, by
and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate.</p>

<p>In absolute monarchies this power rests in the hands of the
King or Emperor alone. As before stated, every government
may confer the power to negotiate a treaty upon such agents
as it pleases. It also has the power to prescribe such modes
of ratifying or confirming it, as it pleases.</p>

<p>5. But when once made and approved, it becomes binding
not only upon the respective governments that made it, but
upon all the citizens and subjects of that government. It has
been held in this country by our greatest lawyers and statesmen,
that the provisions of a treaty bind Congress, the
President, and every citizen as much as any Constitutional
provision or act of Congress. And for this reason our treaties
are published in the papers in every State and Territory in the
Union, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the laws
of Congress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>6. The violation of a treaty by either of the parties thereto,
is reprehensible and criminal. It is derogatory to the character
of any nation or individual that does it. It destroys the
confidence of one nation in the other, leads to unfriendly feelings
and acts between the parties, and may bring on a war, if
satisfaction is not given. Yet such things have been done,
and evil consequences have always followed. “If you make a
bargain, stick to it,” is a common, trite, and wise saying.</p>

<p>Just here it seems proper to call attention to the fact that
the Constitution prohibits any State from making any treaty
with any foreign government. The reason for this provision is
very obvious, for, if allowed, a State might confer privileges upon
foreign powers which would be incompatible with the interests
of other States. Therefore the treaty-making power is kept
wholly in the hands of the general government, for in it every
State has its representatives, and a voice in every treaty which
it makes.</p>

<p>7. So numerous are the treaties which the United States
has made with nearly every civilized nation upon earth, that
it would require a very large volume to contain them. They
are published with the laws, and generally in English and in
the language of the nation with whom the treaty is made.
They may be found in the United States Statutes at Large.
It would require too much space in a work of this kind, to give
even their titles.</p>

<p>8. Wars have been stopped; boundary lines between
nations have been established; commercial intercourse arranged;
the purchase and sale of lands, and a variety of other
things have been the subjects, and formed the matter of
treaties. Several of our most important ones relate to the
purchase of territory. We acquired the States of Louisiana,
Arkansas, and Missouri, by a treaty with France in 1803. It
was called the Louisiana purchase; for it was nothing more
than a purchase and sale of lands. We also acquired Florida
of Spain, in 1819, in the same way, and California and New
Mexico of Mexico, in 1847.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>9. The immense quantities of land purchased of the Indians,
were obtained by treaties with them. We are sorry to
say that in some cases they have treacherously violated their
treaty obligations; but at the same time it should be said by
way of extenuating their offense, that our own government
agents appointed for the purpose of taking care of the interests
of the poor Indians, have, in connection with the white traders
among them, shamefully cheated and wronged them, and provoked
them not only to disregard their obligations, but to
perpetrate murders, robberies, and thefts upon the whites who
live near them. At different times during the years past, the
Indians have been very hostile to us, and have waged war
against the whites in their vicinity for the reasons above stated.
“Honesty is the best policy.”</p>

<p>10. In the early part of the year 1867, a treaty was negotiated
by William H. Seward, our Secretary of State, on the
part of the United States, and Edward de Stoekl, the Russian
Minister to the United States, on the part of Russia, for the
cession of the Russian possessions in North America to the
United States.</p>

<p>This treaty may be regarded as one of the most important of
all our treaties with foreign powers; for by it the United States
acquire between 350,000 and 400,000 square miles of territory,
in addition to our already immense possessions; and it places by
far the greater part of the Northwestern coast of North America
under the control of the United States government.</p>

<p>For the purpose of giving a specimen of a treaty, and showing
some of the details of this negotiation, we here insert it in
full, as agreed upon by the contracting parties. $7,000,000 in
gold is the consideration which the United States paid Russia
for this territory. This treaty has been ratified by the United
States and Russian governments, and the money, ($7,000,000
in gold) has been appropriated for the purpose, and paid to the
Russian Minister.</p>

<h5>THE RUSSIAN TREATY.</h5>

<p>The following is the text of the Russian-American treaty:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The United States of America, and his Majesty, the Emperor
of all the Russias, being desirous of strengthening, if
possible, the good understanding which exists between them,
have for that purpose appointed as their plenipotentiaries, the
President of the United States, William H. Seward, Secretary
of State, and his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, Mr.
Edward de Stoekl, his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary to the United States, and the said plenipotentiaries,
having exchanged their full powers, which were found
to be in due form, have agreed upon and signed the following
articles:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article I.</span> His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias,
agrees to cede to the United States, by this convention, immediately
upon the exchange of the ratifications thereof, all the
territory and dominion now possessed by his said Majesty on
the continent of America and in the adjacent islands, the same
being contained within the geographical limits herein set forth,
to wit: The eastern limit is the line of demarcation between
the Russian and British possessions in North America, as established
by the convention between Russia and Great Britain,
of February 28 (16), 1825, and described in articles third and
fourth of said convention in the following terms: Commencing
from the southernmost point of the island called Prince of
Wales’ Island—which point lies in the parallel of 50 deg. 40
min. north latitude, and between the 131st and 133d deg. of
west longitude, meridian of Greenwich—the said line shall
ascend to the north along the channel called Portland Channel,
as far as the point of the continent where it strikes the 56th
degree of north latitude. From this last mentioned point
the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains
situated parallel to the coast as far as the point of
intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude of the same
meridian, and finally from the said point of intersection the
said meridian line of the 141st degree in its prolongation as
far as the Frozen Ocean. With reference to the line of demarcation
laid down in the preceding article, it is understood—first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
that the island called Prince of Wales’ Island shall belong
wholly to Russia, and now, by this cession, wholly to the
United States; second, that whenever the summit of the mountains
which extend in a direction parallel to the coast from the
56th degree of north latitude to the point of intersection of
the 141st degree west longitude shall prove to be at the distance
of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the
limit between the British possessions and the line of coast
which is to belong to Russia as above mentioned—that is to say,
the limit of the possessions ceded by this convention—shall
be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and
which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues
therefrom. The western limit, within which the territories
and dominion conveyed are contained, passes through a point
in Behring’s Strait on the parallel of 65 deg. 30 min. north
latitude, at its intersection by the meridian which passes midway
between the island of Krusenstern, or Ignaalook, and the
island of Ratmanog, or Noonerbook, and proceeds due north
without limitation into the same Frozen Ocean. The same
western limit beginning at the same initial point, proceeds
thence in a course nearly northwest through Behring’s Strait
and Behring’s Sea, so as to pass midway between the north-west
part of the island of St. Lawrence and the south-east
point of Cape Choukottki to the meridian of 172 deg. west
longitude. Thence, from the intersection of that meridian, in
a south-westerly direction, so as to pass midway between the
island of Attou and the copper island of the Koranddorski
couplet or group in the North Pacific Ocean, to the meridian
of 193 deg. west longitude, so as to include in the territory
conveyed the whole of the Aleutian Islands east of that
meridian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> In the cession of territory and dominion made
by the preceding article, are included the right of property
in all public lots and squares, vacant lands, and all public
buildings, barracks, and other edifices which are not private,
individual property. It is, however, understood and agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that the churches which have been built in the ceded territory
by the Russian government shall remain the property of such
members of the Greek Oriental Church resident in the territory
as may choose to worship therein. Any government
archives, papers, and documents relative to the territory and
domain aforesaid, which may be now existing there, will be
left in possession of the agent of the United States; but an
authenticated copy of such of them as may be required will
be at all times given by the United States to the Russian government,
or to such Russian officers or subjects as may apply
for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> The inhabitants of the ceded territory, according
to their choice, reserving their natural allegiance, may return
to Russia within three years; but if they should prefer to
remain in the ceded territory, they, with the exception of uncivilized
tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the
rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United
States, and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment
of their liberty, property, and religion. The uncivilized
tribes will be subject to such laws and regulations as the United
States may from time to time adopt in regard to aboriginal
tribes of that country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, shall
appoint, with convenient dispatch, an agent or agents, for the
purpose of formally delivering to a similar agent or agents,
appointed on behalf of the United States, the territory, dominion,
property, dependencies, and appurtenances which are
ceded as above, and for doing any other act which may be necessary
in regard thereto; but the cession, with the right of immediate
possession, is nevertheless to be deemed complete and
absolute on the exchange of ratifications, without waiting for
such formal delivery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> Immediately after the exchange of the ratifications
of this convention, any fortifications or military posts which
may be in the ceded territory shall be delivered to the agent
of the United States, and any Russian troops which may be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the territory shall be withdrawn as soon as may be reasonably
and conveniently practicable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> In consideration of the cession aforesaid, the
United States agree to pay, at the Treasury in Washington,
within —— months after the exchange of the ratifications of
this convention, to the diplomatic representative, or other agent
of His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, duly authorized
to receive the same, —— million dollars in gold. The cession
of territory and dominion herein made is hereby demanded to
be free and unincumbered by any reservations, privileges, franchises,
grants, or possessions, by any associated companies,
whether corporate or incorporate, Russian or any other, or by
any parties except merely private individual property holders;
and the cession hereby made conveys all the rights, franchises,
and privileges now belonging to Russia in the said territory or
dominion and appurtenances thereto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> When this convention shall have been duly ratified
by the President of the United States, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, on the one part, and on the
other by His Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, the ratifications
shall be exchanged at Washington within —— from
the date hereof, or sooner, if possible. In faith whereof the
respective plenipotentiaries have signed this convention, and
thereto affixed the seals of their arms.</p>

<h5>EXTRADITION TREATIES.</h5>

<p>1. Treaties have been made from time immemorial between
rulers and nations for the purpose of promoting the interests
of one or both parties in their commercial relations, or to secure
allies in war; but the kind of treaties mentioned at the head
of this section are of modern origin; and shows strongly
the progress of nations toward a substantial unity of interests
and of discipline.</p>

<p>2. The security of society demands that when men commit
a crime in one place they shall not be able to find a safe asylum
to which they may fly whenever the retributions of the law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
which watches over the welfare of the citizen, threaten to overtake
them. The readiness with which criminals can pass from
one country to another since steam has made travel so speedy
and pursuit for any long distance so difficult, increases the evil.
When criminals fly to another country they cannot be punished
there, since their courts have no jurisdiction over a
criminal from another nation, unless the act was committed in
the country where they were established; nor are governments
usually willing to deliver an individual on accusation only,
unless there is an express stipulation, or treaty to this effect,
between them. To overcome the difficulty a treaty was made
in 1842 between this country and England, in which it was
mutually agreed that each country, on the demand of the government
of the other, should give up criminals of certain kinds
named in the treaty, when these after the crime had fled into
their jurisdiction. It worked well, since it multiplied the
chances of punishment, and tended to check crime.</p>

<p>3. Subsequently, treaties of the same kind were made
between the United States and the following countries:</p>

</table>

<p>The time is probably not distant when treaties of this sort
will be made between us and all the civilized nations of the
world; for the intercourse between us and foreign nations is
greater than ever before.</p>

<p>The effect of these international arrangements is to render
the perpetration of crime more dangerous than it would be if
they did not exist. Flight from the country where the crime
was committed was formerly one of the most effectual methods
of escaping the penalty. But extradition treaties, Atlantic
cables, and land telegraphs, have nearly spoiled this game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>3. An extradition treaty, then, is a mutual agreement between
two nations to deliver up, each to the other, upon demand
and proper proof of criminality, such persons as have committed
crimes in one country and then fled to the other, that
they may be taken back, tried, and punished where the offense
was committed. But these demands for escaped criminals can
not be sustained if made for every crime whatever. They will
only be complied with when the crime is one which is named
in the treaty itself. These crimes, upon examination of a
number of such treaties, we find to be: 1. Murder, or an
assault with an intent to commit murder. 2. Piracy. 3. Arson.
4. Robbery. 5. Forgery, or the uttering of forged
papers, or the making or circulating counterfeit money, either
paper or coin. 6. Rape. 7. Embezzlement, and 8. Burglary.</p>

<p>4. It should be observed that a mere demand for an alleged
offender is not sufficient. Proof enough to convince the judge
before whom the case is brought must accompany the demand.
He must be satisfied that the party demanded has committed
the alleged offense; when this is done the judge reports his
finding to the Secretary of State, whose duty then is, under
his hand and seal of office, to issue the final writ of extradition;
after which the criminal may be taken out of the United States
(by force, if necessary), and back to the country where he committed
the crime, there to be dealt with according to the laws
which he violated.</p>

<p>5. In some of our extradition treaties it is expressly stipulated
that neither party (government) shall be bound to surrender
its own citizens, or any person for merely a political offense.
In others it is agreed that the provisions in the treaty shall not
apply to cases where the crime was perpetrated before the
treaty was made. This plea, we think, would be held to be a
good defense in all cases, whether so stipulated in the treaty
or not.</p>

<p>6. The treaties between different nations for the surrender
of criminals are so analogous to one of the provisions contained
in our Constitution, that to insert it here will give the reader a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
clear comprehension of its meaning. It is found in the second
section of article 4, and reads thus:</p>

<p>“A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or other
crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another
State, shall, on demand of the executive authority of the State
from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State
having jurisdiction of the crime.”</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES.</span></h4>

<p>1. These officers, called Consuls, are employed by most civilized
nations, all those at least who have an extensive intercourse
with foreign countries, and they are recognized by the Law of
Nations as being clothed, when acting in their official capacity,
with the authority and inviolability of their respective governments.
Their place of official business is protected by the flag
of their country, an insult to which renders reparation or war
necessary to maintain its honor. Consuls are agents of their
governments, but most of their duties have reference to the
interests of private citizens who may be within their Consulate.
There may be a great number of them in one country, and they
are usually located in the seaports.</p>

<p>2. The Constitution provides that the President and Senate
shall appoint all our Consuls. The President signs their commissions,
which bear the great seal of the United States, and
which prove to the government where they are sent that they
are duly appointed and authorized to discharge the duties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Consuls at the ports or places to which they have been appointed.</p>

<p>3. In order to show the nature of a Consul’s duties, such
as the laws impose upon him, we will state the substance of
several acts relating to this subject.</p>

<p>1. Whenever a vessel belonging to a citizen of the United
States arrives at the port where he is stationed, it is his duty
to receive the ship’s papers, and to see if they are all correct.</p>

<p>2. It is his duty to provide for sick, disabled, and destitute
American seamen, and to send them home by some vessel going
to the United States.</p>

<p>3. He must hear the complaints of seamen, and settle disputes
between the captain and men; and for good cause he may
discharge the whole ship’s crew.</p>

<p>4. It is made his duty to receive and take care of the personal
property of any citizen of the United States who has died
within his Consulate, and to send any balance which may be
left after paying his debts and necessary expenses, to the treasury
of the United States, to be held in trust for the legal claimants.
He must also give notice to the Secretary of State of
the death of such person.</p>

<p>4. For the purpose of carrying out and executing certain
treaties made between the United States and China, Japan,
Siam, and Turkey, Consuls to those countries have been empowered
with judicial functions. They were allowed to act as
judges, and to try and punish citizens of the United States
who had committed crimes there. These, however, were extraordinary
powers in special cases, and by no means common to
the consular office.</p>

<p>5. In the absence of a minister or diplomatic agent of the
United States, the President may authorize a Consul to perform
the duties of such foreign minister; but these powers are rarely
conferred on them. Their ordinary duties relate to commercial
affairs, and to such as are before stated.</p>

<p>6. A Vice-Consul, or deputy Consul, is one appointed to
act temporarily in case of sickness or absence of the Consul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
His powers, while acting, are the same as those of the Consul
in whose place he acts. Every Consul is required to give bonds
for the faithful performance of his duties.</p>

<p>7. Our commerce has been extended to almost every part
of the globe, and for this reason we need a great number of
these officials. Their services are required at all great seaports,
and at many smaller ones. The compensation varies according
to the amount of business to be transacted by them, from
$7,500 down to $500. Some do not receive any salary, but
are allowed the fees they are authorized to charge for their
services.</p>

<p>8. It is his duty to give his government and countrymen
all such information as he possesses in relation to the laws and
practices of the country to which he is sent, which it would
be important for them to know; and especially is it his duty
to look after the interests and welfare of his countrymen when
they are within his Consulate, and to see that no wrong or
injustice is done to them by the people or government where
he resides.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">PASSPORTS.</span></h4>

<p>1. These are written documents, in due official form, signed
and sealed by the proper authority, to convey official information,
or serve as a means of protection, and to readily distinguish
the American Citizen abroad, or to give a permission or
authority to go where those not having passports are forbidden
to go. The passport conveys authentic information to whom it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
may concern, to what nation the bearer of the passport belongs;
and second, to protect him, and secure to him all the rights
and privileges which the government has a right to claim for
its citizens by virtue of any treaty of amity and friendship
existing between it and the country whither its citizens may go.</p>

<p>The passport informs the world that the bearer of it is a citizen
of the United States, and that he travels under its protection,
and that it would demand and exact satisfaction of any
one who wronged or injured him who bears such credentials.</p>

<p>2. In the United States, the Secretary of State is the officer
authorized by law to issue passports. He has the authority
also to cause them to be issued in foreign countries by our foreign
ministers and consuls, under such restrictions and rules
as may be designated by the President. This is allowed as a
matter of convenience to our citizens who happen to be in foreign
countries without them; who need their protection, and
who would be subjected to much delay and expense by going
or sending home to procure them.</p>

<p>Passports are not granted to any other than citizens of the
United States, whether issued by the Secretary or by any diplomatic
or consular agent of our government.</p>

<p>3. Besides these passports, which are given only to our own
citizens when in foreign countries, or who intend to go there,
there is another kind issued to foreigners who wish to go
among the Indians in the Indian territory, or on the Indian
reservations. Indeed, our own citizens are not allowed to go
among them without permission. But foreigners cannot go
without a passport from the Secretary of War, which specifies
the route over which the bearer must pass, and the length of
time he is allowed to remain among them. This is done to
prevent unfriendly foreigners from fomenting mischief, or from
exciting unkind feelings towards our government or people.
Such unfriendly feelings have been created by foreigners, and
we have often experienced the bitter fruits of it, especially in
times of war.</p>

<p>4. Still another kind of passports is used in this country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and should be noticed under this head. They are passports for
American ships or vessels. When they are about to sail for a
foreign port, the laws of the United States require each to procure
one, under a penalty or fine of two hundred dollars upon
the master if he departs from the United States for a foreign
country (other than some port in America), without it. The
passport is prepared by the Secretary of State and is approved
by the President. This is given to the master by the collector
of the port from which the vessel sails, and is one of the ship’s
papers, by which her nationality is known, and her protection
shown to be that of the United States.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY.</span></h4>

<p>1. If the Executive Department that has charge of the
public moneys is not highest in nominal rank, it certainly does
not hold a less important and interesting place in the estimation
of the country and of the world than the Department of
State. Every part of the government is dependent on this for
its efficiency. It is the heart of the country. The in-and-out-flowing
of the tide of money from the central point marks the
pulses of the nation’s prosperity. Especially has this been the
case since the Civil War, and the immense developments and
changes that followed it. The banking system, making the
Treasury responsible for the issue of all the hundreds of millions
of bank notes used in the business of the country, adds
immensely to the importance of the United States Treasury.</p>

<p>2. The management of this Department is committed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the Secretary of the Treasury. He is selected for that office
by the President, and when his nomination is approved by the
Senate his appointment takes place. He holds office during a
presidential term, unless sooner removed. He is a member of
the Cabinet and one of the President’s advisers.</p>

<p>3. The financial policy adopted by the country depends very
much on his views on that difficult question, and the interests
and wealth of millions on the ability and integrity he possesses.
He is therefore chosen on account of his real or supposed
qualifications on questions of finance.</p>

<p>He is aided in his duties by an Assistant Secretary, a Comptroller
and Second Comptroller, five Auditors, a Treasurer and
his assistant, a Register and his assistant, a Commissioner of
Customs, a Comptroller of the Currency and his deputy, and
a Solicitor of the Treasury. All these have their offices in
connection with the Treasury Department at Washington.
In several of the large cities are sub-treasuries, each presided
over by an assistant Treasurer, where public funds are received
and disbursed. The Treasurers of the Mints are also, many
of them, Assistant Treasurers of this Department. All these
are appointed by the President and Senate in the same manner
as the Chief Secretary.</p>

<p>4. The sums of money actually handled, and the accounts
of all moneys received and disbursed without passing into the
vaults of the Treasury, amount to many hundreds of millions
annually, and require the constant service of some hundreds
of clerks. These all need to have clean hands and pure hearts,
which is, unfortunately, more rare among men of all classes
than could be wished. Yet the whole is reduced to so accurate
a system that a loss at any point immediately produces a disturbance
in the whole machinery, and a short examination suffices
to reveal the point of difficulty and the person responsible
for it. Accordingly, losses and defalcations are seldom experienced
in or near the central point of the Department. If
they occur, which is sometimes the case, it is usually some
officer at a distance who is found to be at fault, whose sphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of operations lies far from the centre and only occasionally
passes under scrutiny. Each has his separate sphere of duties
which no one else interferes with, and assumes his own responsibility;
and probably no other institution in the world loses
less in proportion to the amount of money involved and the
number of persons handling it.</p>

<p>5. Every account must be carefully examined and approved
by the proper officer before it can be presented for settlement
and the money paid out, and whatever moneys may flow in,
none can flow out but according to some law of Congress definitely
appropriating it.</p>

<p>All officers having the handling of public funds are required
to give security for the faithful discharge of their duties. This
must, by the requirement of the law, be done before they can
enter their respective places.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF THE U. S.</span></h4>

<p>1. Revenue, or the income of the government, is derived
from various sources. A tax—or duty, as it is often called—laid
on goods imported into the country, is one of the most
important. It is easy for a government to manage without
producing a very sensible effect on the people, and has been a
favorite mode of raising a revenue with nearly all governments
since commerce became general.</p>

<p>2. The sale of public lands has, in this country, been a
source of large revenue; though the desire to encourage emigration
and develop the unsettled parts has led the government
to sell them for a nominal sum. Still, these lands were so
attractive and extensive as to sell rapidly and produce a considerable
income. The Post Office Department has been a
source of income, in great part supporting itself. Duties paid
on the tonnage of vessels, the forfeiture of goods smuggled, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
introduced into the country without paying the lawful tax or
duty, and the forfeiture of vessels used in that unlawful trade,
prizes taken in war, and fees required to be paid to various
officials when their services are employed, are minor sources
of revenue.</p>

<p>3. When all these are not sufficient, as in time of war, or
when an immense war debt is to be paid, direct taxes are laid
on the property and business of the country. This is called</p>

<h5>THE INTERNAL REVENUE,</h5>

<p class="noindent">and is borne with more or less patience, according as the people
regard the end to be gained important. The revenues of the
States are mostly derived from this source. They are not
allowed to raise their revenue from foreign commerce, since
that would be a tax on goods liable to be paid by the people of
another State.</p>

<p>4. The necessity of laying large direct taxes does not, in
this country, often arise in case of the General Government;
but during and after the gigantic Civil War between the North
and South, when enormous expenses had to be met, and the
credit of the government sustained, the direct taxes became
very large indeed. In 1861 Congress passed the “Internal
Revenue Law,” by which twenty millions of dollars were to
be annually raised from direct taxes on houses and lands in
each of the States and Territories.</p>

<p>By subsequent acts not only houses and lands were taxed,
but almost every sort of property and business. Licenses were
required for persons to carry on their profession, trade, or business;
incomes were taxed; deeds, mortgages, notes, bonds, bank
checks, and papers of almost every kind were invalid unless
they had a revenue stamp upon them. Manufacturers had to
pay a certain per-centage on whatever they made. Scarcely
any calling, trade, profession, or business escaped it, directly
or indirectly.</p>

<p>5. To carry out these provisions, the whole country was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
divided into Revenue Districts, corresponding, so far as convenient,
with Congressional Districts. An officer of the Treasury
Department, called the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
was appointed, charged with the duty of preparing instructions,
forms, blanks, stamps, and licenses, to be used in the collection
by the multitude of minor officers employed, and of overseeing
the whole work. Each district had its chief officer, and
his deputies, assessors, and collectors, by whom the money at
length reached the Treasury at Washington. It created an
army of officers to be paid. It was laid aside as soon as possible,
and taxation made less onerous and expensive. The remarkable
prosperity of the country at that particular period made
it easier to bear. Direct taxes laid by the General Government
are more economically collected by the State or local officials,
in all ordinary cases. This was a very extraordinary and pressing
one, and the people were so eager to put their debt in the
way of extinction that it was endured with much patience for
several years, when most of this cumbrous and costly machinery
was laid aside.</p>

<p>6. The vast war debt, the large number of government
officers employed in attending to the interests of so large and
prosperous a country, the support of the army and navy,
the great number of foreign representatives and agents of the
government, and the public works necessary for the development
or protection of the country, make a large revenue indispensable.</p>

<p>7. It is best when the people are free and intelligent that
they be governed as little as possible—or rather that they govern
themselves as much as possible, and that as few officials as
may be live on the fruits of other people’s labor. There must
necessarily be an army of them, at the least; but such arrangements
should be made that public expenses may be reduced, to
the lowest point, and republican simplicity everywhere reign.</p>

<p>The principle and habit of public economy should be earnestly
insisted on, since the handling of immense sums of public
money is much more demoralizing than the acquisition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
private wealth in legitimate ways. It is a strong temptation
to men of weak moral character; and private property is more
likely to be carefully used and economically expended than
public funds. The smaller the revenue, consistent with the
general development of the country, the better.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">DUTIES AND TARIFFS.</span></h4>

<p>1. Duty is a term used to designate a sum paid by foreign
merchandise coming to our country for sale, for the privilege
of entering and being offered to purchasers. Tariff is a rate, or
scale, of duties.</p>

<p>2. Ever since intercourse has become frequent between different
nations commerce has been occupied in effecting interchanges
of the products and industries of each country with
others. Each country has peculiarities that specially fit it for
the production or manufacture of some article, or list of articles,
which others would be unable to produce, or would produce
at greater inconvenience and expense, and which is of
high value to all, or many of the others. The social principle
has proved to be of extreme value to the improvement of
men, and to their happiness; and we might say that, in this
unequal distribution of capacities in the lands, and the races
who inhabit them, the exercise of the social principle, on a
broad scale, was made, by nature, indispensable.</p>

<p>3. Each nation, then, devotes itself to its special features of
production, and exchanges its surplus with others for what it
wants of their different surplus, to mutual profit. Just as A
is a farmer, and raises grain, while B is a mechanic. Each has
a natural adaptation to the business he pursues, and each needs
what the other produces. So they exchange, and each has the
full benefit of the success and different genius and resources of
the other. Commerce is the same in principle, and interchange
becomes constantly more extensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Government naturally regulates commerce because it is
one of the general interests of the country. It finds an indefinite
amount of foreign merchandise waiting to enter to be put
on sale. It was long ago discovered that here was a convenient
mode of producing a government income without disturbing
the people with a constant demand for money to pay
its expenses. Whatever foreign goods had to pay for permission
to enter, was quietly added to the price afterward, and so
the people paid their taxes to the government in an indirect
way in the form of a Duty. They pay the price asked, if it
be within their means, without knowledge, or thought, of what
part goes to the government, unless they study the subject carefully.</p>

<p>It has always been the case, then, that a government could
get all the money it wanted, from this source, in ordinary
times, with very little trouble. That mode is naturally a favorite
with them. Whether it is the best way for the people is
another question, which has been, at different times, very
warmly debated in our government. It is not our place here
to take up the argument, but it is worthy of a careful study by
the people.</p>

<p>5. A Tariff of duties is established to carry on the government.
There is another object that has had many advocates,
and has quite commonly exerted an influence to raise the tariff
on some things. It is stated in the preamble, or introduction,
to the first act passed by the first Congress, on this subject,
July 4th, 1789, “Whereas, it is necessary for the support of the
government, for the discharge of the debts of the United
States, <i>and the encouragement and protection of manufactures</i>,
that duties be laid on goods, wares, and merchandise
imported.” It was considered important to protect and encourage
our manufactures, by putting so high a price on the same
kind of foreign goods that ours would have the advantage and
sell at a <i>less price</i> or greater profit.</p>

<p>This might have been a wise measure, in the early days of the
country, when there were few manufactures. Whether it has
been so since, or is so now, is not so clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Every man should make up his mind what is right and
best and act as he sees to be most for the general good. It has
two disadvantages. It embarrasses the interchange that we
have described as so profitable, and under a high tariff sometimes
practically forbids it. It is unsocial, and we declare by
it, that we will, so far as possible, live within ourselves, and
have as little to do with our neighbors as we can. Besides, it
is our own people who have to pay the duty, mainly, if they
use the foreign goods; or the higher price on domestic goods
if they buy them; so that one class of the people, that is, the
mass of them, pay another small class large sums to manufacture
what might be bought from foreigners with less money.
It is a fine thing for the manufacturers, but not quite so fine
for those who buy them, unless they feel like making their
countrymen a present for every piece of goods he will manufacture
for them, beside the proper cost as made by others.</p>

<p>It has the advantage of encouraging industries of different
kinds; and has been believed to contribute greatly to the general
prosperity in that way. Some think it best to let all those
things arrange themselves, and leave each nation to bring us
what they can produce cheapest and sell them more of what we
can produce cheapest. They believe this is the secret of prosperity,
besides being more social. It is a question to be carefully
examined. It seems probable, that, in the end, all
nations will agree on this policy, and raise their revenue in
some other way. It is perhaps too soon to expect that, as yet.</p>

<p>We have never been without a tariff, though there has been
much discussion in Congress, and between parties, whether it
should be protective or not. So it has often changed from low
to high and back again. The necessities of our war, and the
heavy debt, made it important, in the highest degree, to raise
all the revenue we could, and the subject has not been much
discussed for many years.</p>

<p>7. The Duties are mostly collected in the cities, and, as
foreign goods come mainly by water, in the seaports of the
country. Duties are often called Customs, and the places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
they are collected Custom Houses; and the officers Custom
House Officers. These places are located in ports along our sea
coast, and there are some thousands of custom house officers of
all grades. The buildings erected by the government have cost
many millions of dollars. The larger part of the duties are
collected in the great seaport cities, as Boston, New York, Baltimore,
New Orleans, and San Francisco.</p>

<p>Places, designated for foreign vessels to present their goods
for examination and collection of the duty, are called Ports of
Entry. If they are delivered at some other place, where there
is no custom house they are called Ports of Delivery.</p>

<p>8. Congress alone has power to lay these duties. There are
two modes of imposing them; sometimes one and sometimes
the other being adopted, according to the views of the Congress
legislating. They are called specific and ad valorem
duties. Ad valorem means, according to the cost, and is
counted on the cost in the country the article comes from.
Specific duties are so much on the article, without regard to the
cost. On many things imported there is no duty, and they are
called “free goods.”</p>

<p>Changes are continually made in the tariff to conform to the
requirements of the Treasury, the desires of the people, and
the changing views of the legislators.</p>

<h5>DRAWBACKS.</h5>

<p>9. When the duties on foreign goods have been paid, and
they are afterwards exported, the duties which have been paid
are refunded to the owner. The money thus paid back is
called a drawback. All imported goods are entitled to drawback
whenever they are taken out of the United States.</p>

<h5>BOUNTIES ON EXPORTED GOODS,</h5>

<p class="noindent">take money out of, instead of putting it in the treasury, yet the
government in a few cases has allowed bounties upon exported
articles. Fish taken by American vessels, refined sugar and
distilled spirits made from imported sugar and molasses, are
examples. This was done to encourage domestic industry and
enterprise.</p>

<p>* The percentages in these columns are approximately, not absolutely correct, owing
to the fact that the rates are computed upon the value of merchandise, etc., imported,
instead of the value of goods entering into consumption in the respective years.</p>

<p>† These amounts do not include imports into the Southern ports during the war, from
which no revenue was derived, namely, in 1861, $17,089,234; in 1862, $90,789; and in 1864,
$2,220.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<h5>TONNAGE.</h5>

<p>11. Tonnage designates the capacity of a vessel for carrying
goods, which depends on the tons of weight it can receive, and
is computed by assigning so much space, in height, length, and
breadth, to each ton. A revenue, additional to that raised
from the goods brought in vessels, is produced by a tax on the
tonnage, or carrying capacity of vessels.</p>

<p>It is laid, not only on foreign vessels, trading with our seaports,
but on our own vessels; a distinction being made so
as to produce protection in favor of our own commerce and
ship-builders. This also is paid by those who buy the goods
brought in these vessels; since whatever duty is laid on the
carrying trade must be made up by the higher price of the article
brought. It is a way of levying taxes without directly
calling the attention of the people to the fact.</p>

<p>12. It is worthy of careful consideration whether the country
would not gain as much, by removing all these embarrassments
to commerce with other countries, and different points
on our coasts, as has been gained by free trade between the different
States. The Constitution forbids taxes to be levied on
inter-State commerce, or trade, and the country is undoubtedly
the gainer by such a provision.</p>

<p>In 1790 a tonnage duty of 50 cents per ton was laid on foreign
vessels, and six cents on American vessels. During the
Civil War the tonnage duty was raised ten cents per ton on
both foreign and American shipping.</p>

<p>Tonnage is collected only once a year by the collector of the
port where the vessel happens to be.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">COLLECTION OF DUTIES.</span></h4>

<p>1. The Tariff, or Scale of Duties, laid by the Laws of Congress,
on goods brought from foreign countries, requires to be
paid when they are first introduced; or we might say, <i>before</i>
they are introduced. All these goods are stopped as they
approach the boundary line, or <i>on</i> the boundary line, and
carefully examined; and they can go no farther until the duties
imposed by Congress are received. When they have “passed
the Custom House” they may be as freely sold as goods produced
at home. No government officer has any right to interfere
with them. They have paid the duty and have the freedom
of the land. If they, by any chance or effort, get in by any
other way, they are treated as stolen goods, and may be seized
and confiscated. However much they may have cost their
owners, however highly they may prize them, however unquestioned
was their ownership before they passed the limits of the
country, if they are introduced by any other than the Custom
House Door, all right and title to them by the former owners
ceases, and they become the property of the government.</p>

<p>2. So carefully is this point guarded that not only are
government officers provided for the sole purpose of watching
against this illegal introduction of goods, but a premium is
offered to unofficial persons to secure their aid. Any one who
can point out (and prove the fact) goods of any kind, liable to
duty, that have not passed the custom house, and paid that
duty, is entitled to half the value of the goods; the other half
belonging to the government. Smuggling, as bringing goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
into the country without paying the duty is called, is held to
be robbery of the government, and ranks as a serious offense;
and it really is so, as long as the government produces its
income, or part of it, in this way. The law makes it part proprietor
in the property until its claim is settled. Besides, to
take from the government is to take from the people; since
they must make up, in some other way, for what is subtracted
in this.</p>

<p>3. To secure this payment of Duty, then, a large number
of officers of different grades are appointed, not only to examine
the goods, determine the amount required to be paid, receive
the money and keep all the accounts connected with it, but to
take care that all the goods, of whatever kind, that are not
permitted an entrance free of duty, shall duly pass examination,
and be “entered,” as it is called, at the custom house.</p>

<p>4. The Head of these officers is the</p>

<h5>COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS.</h5>

<p class="noindent">He superintends the Customs Bureau in the Treasury Department.
He is nominated, and, with the consent of the Senate,
appointed by the President. All the accounts of officers employed
in the collection of duties on imports pass through his
bureau for examination and adjustment; he prepares the forms
of all papers used in this department of the revenue; directs
the form of keeping the accounts; brings suits when necessary
for the recovery of money due from officers of the department;
and makes a report of any neglect of duty to Congress. A
complete summary, therefore, of the past and present condition
of the customs department may be found, at any time, in his
office. With so perfect a system of supervision it does not
matter how extensive the organization may be. No confusion
is possible. There are more than 30,000 persons employed
Under this officer; and they are scattered through the whole
country where there are Ports of Entry or Delivery, as well as
keeping guard along the whole coast line and frontier of the
United States; yet they are under as complete discipline and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
surveillance as the army or navy. This bureau was organized
in 1849; its business having previously been under the oversight
of the First Comptroller of the Treasury. It has general
supervision of the conduct and accounts of all customs officials.
The highest in rank below this are</p>

<h5>THE COLLECTORS.</h5>

<p>5. Wherever there is a Port of Entry a Collector is appointed
to superintend the collection of duties, receive the
money, and transmit it to the United States Treasury. He is
the principal officer of the Collection District connected with
this Port, which often embraces several Ports of Delivery, and
is required to see that all is properly conducted in his district.
He receives his appointment directly from the President and
Senate, and is removable at the pleasure of the President.</p>

<p>6. As, in ordinary times, the most of the revenue required
for the support of the government is derived from Customs,
this is a responsible office. Great care is required to secure the
services of competent and faithful men, and the bonds they
are required to give are large. He nominates the subordinate
officers connected with his custom-house, and the Secretary of
the Treasury appoints them, if he sees no objection.</p>

<p>7. The Collectors take care that all the goods, on which
Congress has imposed a duty, pay the amount due. To this
end he often requires one or more deputies. The entire commerce
of the part of the country falling in his district, with
other countries, passes under his examination. He receives
all reports, manifests, and documents required to be exhibited
by all vessels, domestic and foreign, on their entry into his port,
and all accounts of all the goods they have on board. On these
he must estimate the duties, receive the moneys, or bonds
securing their payment, and grant all permits for landing the
goods. He transmits, quarterly, all the moneys collected in
his department, with an accurate account of all the transactions
of his office during the quarter, to the Secretary of the Treasury.
These accounts pass to the Customs bureau, and the
money to the Treasurer of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>8. His duties, as described in the previous section, make
him acquainted with all the imports of the country, in his
District or Port. He is also required to examine the manifests
of all the vessels, and the accounts of their cargoes, that leave
his port for a foreign country. This secures a knowledge of
all the exports of the country. It is his duty to give clearances,
or permits, to all vessels leaving for foreign ports. It is unlawful
for any vessel to depart without this document. A ship’s
clearance can be properly given only when her manifest, or
detailed account of the quantity, kind, and value of her cargo
is ascertained to be correct.</p>

<p>9. We give the form of a ship’s Manifest, and also of a
Clearance.</p>

<h5>A SHIP’S MANIFEST.</h5>

<p>“Report and manifest of the cargo laden on board of the
____, whereof ____ is master, which cargo was taken
on board at the port or ports of ____, burthen ____ tons,
built at ____, in the State of ____, and owned by ____,
merchants at ____, and bound for ____.”</p>

<p>This, together with a particular description of the marks and
numbers of every bale, box, case, barrel, bundle or parcel on
board of the vessel, is the manifest. It must be given to the
collector of whatever port the vessel arrives at; and the master
of her must swear that it is in all respects a true and accurate
account of all the cargo on board, to the best of his knowledge
and belief.</p>

<p>10. The collector of the port can then compute the duties
to be paid upon each article, and when these are paid, or secured
to be paid, he gives permits to land the cargo, and deliver the
goods to their respective owners. Then come in the duties of
weighers, gaugers, measurers and inspectors of the customs,
after permits are obtained to land the goods. If they are such
as require to be weighed, gauged, or measured, these officers
are sent to do it; and the inspector must allow nothing to leave
the ship until he has examined the marks and numbers, to see
if they correspond with the permit and the manifest. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
suspects that there is an attempt to defraud the government by
false names and marks, he is authorized to open the package,
box, case, cask, or whatever contains the goods, and to examine
them. In this way smuggling is prevented, and the revenues
arising from duties on imported goods secured.</p>

<h5>A SHIP’S CLEARANCE.</h5>

<p>This document is couched in the following terms:</p>

<p>“<i>District of ____, Port of ____, ss.</i></p>

<p>“These are to certify, to all whom it may concern, that
A. B., master or commander of the ship (brig, barque, schooner)
burthen ____ tons or thereabouts, mounted with ____ guns,
navigated with ____ men, ____. ____ built, and bound for
____, having on board ____, hath here entered and cleared
his said vessel according to law.</p>

<p>“Given under our hands and seals, at the custom-house
of ____, this ____ day of ____, one thousand ____, and
in the ____ year of the Independence of the United States of
America.”</p>

<p>This is signed by the collector and by the naval officer of the
port, when the commander is prepared to depart with his vessel
to his destination.</p>

<p>11. The compensation of collectors is not all given in the
form of a salary, but in part the fees for services rendered, and
part of the forfeitures of smuggled goods. In the larger ports
it is enormous, but in the smaller ones is often insignificant.
It is a common mode of doing business of this kind, and is
supposed to stimulate the activity and secure the faithfulness
of the officer in preventing frauds on the government. The
working of this plan is sometimes complained of as inspiring
an over-officiousness embarrassing to trade and unnecessarily
annoying to importers; and as producing too great an inequality
in incomes. It is difficult to make a system quite perfect.
Whether this admits of improvement remains to be seen.</p>

<h5>SURVEYORS</h5>

<p>12. Are next in rank and authority to the Collectors. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
are appointed in the same manner and receive their compensation
in the same way. The Surveyor’s duty is to superintend
the inspectors, weighers, measurers, and gaugers in his port;
to visit all vessels arriving in it; make a detailed report of them
to the Collector; and examine all goods entered for the benefit
of drawback.</p>

<h5>THE NAVAL OFFICER</h5>

<p>13. Of a port, is another of the superintendents, appointed
to oversee the collection of the revenue. His appointment
depends on the President and Senate, and his compensation on
the amount of business done in his port, in the same manner
as the Collector and Surveyor. His duties are, to some extent,
parallel to those of the Collector; or he may be called a local
examiner and auditor of the Collector’s work and accounts, for
the sake of accuracy and correctness. He receives copies of
all manifests and entries, and computes the duties on all goods,
keeping a separate record of them. He must countersign permits,
clearances, certificates, debentures, and other documents
issued by the Collector. He examines the Collector’s accounts,
bonds, and expenditures, and certifies to them, if correct.</p>

<p>A great number of deputies and employees are required to
carry out the details of the collection of duties, since the entire
amount of imports into the country are required to be carefully
examined.</p>

<h5>REVENUE CUTTERS</h5>

<p>14. Are employed to guard against smuggling. They are
vessels of small size, some steamers, and others sailing vessels,
properly manned and armed, of high powers of speed; and are
stationed as a coast guard near the ports, and lines of ocean
travel, to prevent the landing of imported goods before they
have paid the duty. Their officers are appointed by the President
and Senate.</p>

<p>They look after all the ships going into any port, or any that
may approach the coast; board them when within four leagues
(or 12 miles) of the coast; examine the manifest of the cargo
and every part of the vessel; put proper fastenings on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
hatches, to prevent unlawful communication with the hold
until the Custom’s officers have discharged their duty; and
place a watch on board to remain until the vessel is delivered
into the charge of the proper revenue officer.</p>

<p>15. They are revenue officers, and under the control of the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Collectors at the ports near
which they are stationed. In case the President judges it best,
they may be called on, at his direction, to coöperate with the
Navy, and, in case they are disabled in the discharge of their
duty at such times, are entitled to be treated in the same manner
as officers and sailors in the Navy.</p>

<p>16. These vessels carry a pennant and ensign with such
marks on them as the President may designate. If any vessel
liable to seizure refuses to bring to at the direction of the commander
of the Cutter, he is authorized to fire into it after
having shown his pennant and ensign, and compel it to submit
to be boarded and examined. Much depends on the vigilance
of these revenue cutters, as the sums paid on goods imported
amount to a great many millions of dollars, and want of due
precaution would cause the income of the government to be
defrauded of large sums.</p>

<p>The commanders of revenue cutters report all matters relating
to their duties weekly to the Collector of the port.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">GOVERNMENT COINAGE.</span></h4>

<p>1. The United States mint, located at Philadelphia, is one
of the most important establishments of the government. An
act of Congress, passed in 1792, was the first step towards its
creation. Its design was, and its principal business has been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to coin the precious metals into money. It has been for more
than eighteen hundred years the usage of civilized governments
to coin their own money. Ours, at a very early period of its
existence, began to do the same thing, and will probably continue
to do it as long as it shall exist. Before the art of coining
was known, the precious metals were used as a standard of
value, but they passed from one to another by weight. The
plan of cutting them into small pieces, and then stamping
their value upon them, by which their worth could be known
as soon as seen, was an improvement upon the former mode.
This process is denominated coining. It has of late been
brought so near perfection that our pieces of money are fine
specimens of art.</p>

<p>2. The officers, who manage and conduct the operations of
this establishment, are a Director, a Treasurer, an Assayer, a
Melter and Refiner, a Chief Coiner, and an Engraver. They
are all appointed by the President and Senate in the usual
manner. The director appoints the assistants and clerks.</p>

<p>All must give bonds for the faithful performance of their
respective duties upon which they enter under oath. The
duties of these different officers may almost be known by the
names they bear. The director is the head of the institution,
and the others act under his general direction, each having his
appropriate duties to perform. In the month of January of
each year the director must make a report to the President of
the operations of the mint and its branches for the preceding
year.</p>

<p>3. Any person may take gold or silver bullion or ores to
the mint and receive it back in coin, for a very trifling expense.
Before it is coined, after its value has been determined by the
assayer, the director will give a certificate for it, which is of
the same value as the bullion deposited.</p>

<p>4. We have stated that the principal business at the mint
is the conversion of the precious metals into coin or money.
But this is not its exclusive business. Another part is to melt
and assay these metals, and to run them into ingots or bars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
either of pure or standard gold and silver, according to the
wish of its owner.</p>

<p>Until 1835 the mint at Philadelphia was the only establishment
in the United States for coining money. But in that
year a law was passed establishing branch mints at New
Orleans, in Louisiana; at Charlotte, in North Carolina; and at
Dahlonega, in Georgia. In 1852, another branch was established
in California; in 1862, another at Denver, in Colorado
Territory; and in 1863, another at Carson City, in Nevada
Territory, since made a State; in 1864, another at San Francisco,
in California, and another at Dallas City, in Oregon.
Except the one in California, but little has ever been done at
these branches. They are all similar to the principal one at
Philadelphia; and the laws relating to that are made to apply
to these branches.</p>

<p>6. The Constitution gives Congress the exclusive right to
coin money, and prohibits all the States from doing it. This
Congress does by the laws it passes in relation to the subject,
and the various officers and workmen employed to execute the
work are only the agents of Congress.</p>

<p>The various coins which Congress has from time to time
ordered to be made are of the following names and value:</p>

<p>7. Our coins are not made of pure gold and silver; a certain
amount of other metals being added to produce a coin that
will be less affected by the friction of constant use. This
alloy, or mixture, of the precious metals is called Standard
gold or silver, since a definite amount of the alloy is required
in all the coinage of the government for currency purposes. It
does not alter the value of the coin; that being dependent on
the actual merchantable value of the sum of the metals used.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
By the law of 1837, standard gold and silver were declared to
be nine hundred parts of pure metal, and one hundred parts
alloy—equal to one-tenth alloy. Gold coins are alloyed with
silver and copper, equal parts of each. Silver coins are alloyed
with copper alone. Gold is declared to be worth fifteen times
as much as silver by weight.</p>

<p>In addition to our own coins, Congress has, from time to
time, passed laws declaring the value of foreign coins, and
making them a legal tender. But these laws were all repealed
by the act of 1857, and it was made the duty of the director
of the mint to have them assayed, and to determine their
weight, fineness, and value; for they are still used by banks
and merchants, and pass at the value determined by the mint.</p>

<p>The mint, up to 1861, had coined in gold, silver, and copper
coin, 800,662,475 pieces, worth $799,923,362.</p>

<h5>ASSAY OFFICE.</h5>

<p>1. In 1853 the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to
establish an office in the city of New York for the receipt,
melting, refining and assaying of gold and silver bullion and
foreign coins, and for casting the same into bars, ingots, or
disks. The assistant treasurer of the United States in New
York, is treasurer of this assay office, and the Secretary of the
Treasury appoints such other clerks, assistants, and workmen as
shall be necessary for the management of its business.</p>

<p>2. Persons having gold or silver bullion, ores or foreign
coin, may deposit them in his office, and it will be refined and
assayed (at no more cost than the actual expense of doing the
work), its value ascertained, and the owner will be paid for it
in coins of the same value and metal as that deposited. It is
not coined in this office, but cast into bars, ingots or disks—either
of pure metal or of standard fineness, as the owner may
prefer—the true weight and value of which are stamped
thereon; and the owner may either take them in payment for
his bullion or foreign coin, or it will be coined for him at the
United States Mint, if he wishes. The bars spoken of are often
kept in that form, and are used as coin among banks, brokers,
and merchants, who receive and pay large amounts of the precious
metals. With them it passes as coin, for its exact weight
and value are stamped upon it.</p>

<p>3. This establishment was located at New York more for
the convenience of those who do business there, than for the
necessity of such an institution; for at the mint at Philadelphia
there is a department for doing the same work as is done
here. But at New York there is a larger amount of foreign
coin than in any other place, and it is often advantageous to its
owners to have it converted into American coin, that it may be
used with greater facility. Although many foreign coins do
circulate in this country, but few know their value. Consequently
they do not pass so readily; and for this reason they
are melted and run into bars of known value, or re-coined into
American money.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">NATIONAL BANKING.</span></h4>

<p>1. The present banking system was established by an act of
Congress in 1863. The plan is quite different from any before
in use, and commends itself to the whole country by the stability
it gives to the currency in use in the transaction of its
business, and the security it furnishes against loss of values
common under the old systems. They are managed by private
parties and corporations, apart from the government, but under
a certain degree of supervision, and by its authority. By the
act referred to any number of persons not less than five may
associate themselves together for the purpose of banking, by
compliance with the following conditions:</p>

<p>2. First: They must, under their hands and seals, make a
certificate which shall specify—</p>

<p>1. The name assumed by such association.</p>

<p>2. The place where its business is to be conducted.</p>

<p>3. The amount of its capital stock (which cannot be less than
$50,000), and the number of its shares.</p>

<p>4. The names of its shareholders, and the number of shares
held by each.</p>

<p>5. The time when such association shall commence business.</p>

<p>6. A declaration that said certificate is made to enable such
persons to avail themselves of the advantages of this act.</p>

<p>3. This certificate must be properly acknowledged before
some competent person, and must be sent to the comptroller
of the currency in the Treasury Department, to be recorded
and kept by him. When this, and all other acts which the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
requires, has been done by the association, the comptroller of
the currency gives them a certificate under his hand and official
seal, to that effect, and that they are authorized to commence
business. This constitutes the association a corporation. They
have the right to make and use a common seal, and have all
the rights, and are liable to all the responsibilities of ordinary
legalized corporations; and may exist not to exceed twenty
years from the passage of this act. Every shareholder is made
personally liable for the debts of the association or bank, to the
amount of the par value of his stock.</p>

<p>4. In order to secure the holders of bills issued by these
banks, they must deposit with the Treasurer of the United States,
United States bonds bearing interest to an amount not less than
one-third of the capital stock paid in. These bonds are safely
kept by the Treasurer. The comptroller of the currency then
issues to the bank an amount of bank notes equal to the amount
of bonds thus deposited, less ten per cent. In case the bank
should fail to redeem its circulating bills, its bonds are sold,
and with the proceeds the comptroller of the currency redeems
them, or orders them to be paid at the United States Treasury.
The bonds held by the Treasurer as security for the redemption
of the bills issued by the association, must be transferred to
him in trust; thus giving him entire control of them in case
it becomes necessary to sell them in order to redeem the bills
of any association which may have failed to pay them on
demand.</p>

<p>5. This act has brought a great number of banks into existence,
besides organizing most of the banks formerly existing
under State laws under this system; so that we have a nearly
uniform system of banking all over the United States. The
bills of these banks pass in any part of the country, which was
not often the case formerly. In case the bank should be mismanaged,
or fail to pay for any cause, there is ample security
for their redemption deposited in the United States treasury,
where they will be paid on presentation.</p>

<p>6. The bill-holder is also better protected against counterfeits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
than he was under the old system; for all the bills issued
by these associations are engraved by the government, and the
plates and dies on which they are printed are kept by the comptroller
of the currency in the Treasury Department. The engraving
is done in the best possible manner, and it is exceedingly
difficult to counterfeit them. Besides this, they all have
the imprint of the seal of the Treasury on their face, and are
numbered and countersigned by the treasurer and register.
With all these guards and precautions, we have the best paper
currency ever used since the establishment of the government.</p>

<p>7. This act necessarily threw upon the Treasury Department
a great increase of labor, and in order to provide for it a separate
bureau was created, which is denominated the bureau of
currency, the chief officer of which is called the comptroller
of currency. He acts under the general direction of the Secretary
of the Treasury. This bureau is charged with the execution
of this and all other laws that may be passed by Congress
respecting the national currency. The comptroller of the currency
is appointed by the President and Senate, has a deputy,
receives a salary of $5,000 per year, holds his office five years,
has an official seal, gives bonds to the amount of $100,000, and
takes and subscribes the oath of office prescribed by the Constitution
and the laws. His duties are numerous and very
responsible, he having hundreds of millions under his care.</p>

<p>The term national banks, given to these institutions, and
national currency to the bills they issue, were given from the
fact that they were organized by an act of Congress, and that
the security for the redemption of their bills consists exclusively
of national bonds; no other securities will be taken.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES.</span></h4>

<p>1. The United States government belongs to its people.
Those people own property estimated at upwards of thirty
billions of dollars. The public lands belonging to the government
are between one and one and a half billions of acres.
Besides, the public domains contain gold, silver, iron, coal, and
a large number of other mineral deposits, chiefly in regions
worthless for agricultural purposes, of unknown, but ascertained
to be, at least, a very great quantity—enough to make
all its present inhabitants millionaires if (besides paying the
debt) their value could be divided among them. The capacity
of the country for production is very far beyond what is drawn
from it now. The future will probably increase it a thousand
fold, for we are yet a new people, and in the act of settling
ourselves to the work of development.</p>

<p>We are very rich, if all our resources are taken into account,
yet we are in debt. In five years from the commencement of
the civil war the public debt had run up from less than one hundred
million dollars to over two billion seven hundred millions.
This we began to reduce at once, for as a nation we do not like
to be in debt; and it was, December 1st, 1873, a little over two
billion one hundred and fifty millions. The debt is, indeed, a
trifle compared with our vast national property; but we do not
wish to sell our property at a loss, nor disturb the regular course
of business; so it stands to be gradually paid in the regular
course of things, as we find it to be convenient.</p>

<p>It is a vast sum, but gives more trouble by reason of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
desire and determination of the people to pay it soon, and
sacrifice no property, than from any inability to meet it.</p>

<p>We add a table of the Public Debt for every year since 1791,
a Statement of the debt in detail Dec. 1st, 1873, and various
Statistics relating to the finances, resources, and business of the
country.</p>

<span class="smaller">WAR DEPARTMENT.</span></h4>

<p>Men, unfortunately, have never been able to so arrange
their mutual relations as to dispense with violent and deadly
contests. Although they are less frequent and shorter now
than formerly, they are more costly and more destructive, and
every nation is still, as formerly, obliged to anticipate the possibility
of war and to make provision for its sudden occurrence,
that it may not be borne down and overwhelmed by the first
shock. It is an event so probable, even, and especially if the
country should be in a defenseless state, that it has become a
maxim of prudence with statesmen to avoid war by being prepared
for it. The nation that can best repel an attack is least
likely to be attacked.</p>

<p>Most governments, like our own, had their birth and early
history in the confusion and devastation of that great destroyer
of life and property; and it is natural that the first leisure of
peace should be occupied in preparing themselves, in the most
effective manner possible, for both defensive and offensive operations
in case of its return.</p>

<p>The Constitution contemplates the existence of an army and
navy for warlike purposes, and makes the President Commander-in-chief
of both. The first Congress assembled under the
Constitution hastened, in its first session, to provide him an
army and navy to command by organizing the Department of
War. At its head was placed the Secretary of War, and so
necessary was it deemed to the dignity and security of the
nation that he was made one of the principal officers of the
government, having a seat in the cabinet and being regarded
as one of the advisers of the Chief Magistrate. He is
appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate.
A Chief Clerk, to be appointed by the Secretary, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
provided for by the act of 1789 creating the Department, who
was the second authority in it, and acted as Secretary, in case of
a vacancy; but when the Civil War raised this Department to
great prominence, in 1861, a law was passed authorizing the
appointment of an Assistant Secretary, and, in 1863, two additional
Assistant Secretaries were provided for by law; all to be
appointed by the President. This last measure was temporary
only, designed to expire when returning peace should reduce the
Department to its ordinary condition.</p>

<p>At first the affairs of the national navy were managed by the
Secretary of War. This was changed, as we shall see, when our
commerce and foreign relations became more important.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War ranks next to the President in military
authority and dignity, and has the whole oversight, under him,
of the army and its affairs. He makes out military commissions
to be signed by the President, has the care of providing
for the support, clothing, pay, and equipment of the army, and
of all military stores required to keep the army in efficient
drill, and in readiness against a possible war. He has the care
of all books, records, and papers relating to the army and to
military affairs. The names, grades, time of enlistment, term
of service, and time of mustering out of all officers and privates
in the army, whether in the regular or volunteer service,
are to be found in his office. All military accounts are kept
and adjusted under his supervision. These cares and duties
have become so numerous and important as to require a careful
organization of the Department into sub-departments, or
bureaus, as the Commissary’s, the Quartermaster’s, and the
Ordnance bureaus. The general management of the whole
depending on the Secretary of War, he evidently requires to
be a man of judgment, thoroughly versed in military affairs,
and of eminent organizing ability.</p>

<p>A Solicitor, to have charge of the legal business of this
Department, was provided for by law in 1863, to be appointed
by the President and the Senate.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UNITED STATES ARMY.</span></h4>

<p>1. The military successes of the United States would seem
to prove undeniably, that, if the nation had adopted a career
of conquest as did Ancient Rome, it might have played an
important part in the history of warlike peoples. The undisciplined
militia shut up a strong army in Boston in 1774, and,
had not their powder failed, would very likely have forced the
British to evacuate that place immediately after the battle of
Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>2. Washington’s army, made up in large part of militia,
seemed always on the point of dissolution, and yet the British,
after spending more than a hundred millions in fitting out
armies against them, and possessing the important superiority
of free movement on the sea, for the transportation of forces
easily and rapidly to any desired point, never could gain a permanent
foothold, though opposed only by a ragged, famished,
and half disorganized army.</p>

<p>3. The war of 1812—the Mexican War—and the Civil
War, all bear testimony to the excellence of the material for
military operations to be found among us. Yet we are a peace
loving people. The government has never had more than the
skeleton of an army in times of peace. While the Great
Powers of Europe keep up armies of half a million of men,
our army, very soon after the late gigantic war, was reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to less than 30,000 men; barely enough to keep the Indians in
order, garrison the frontiers slightly, and furnish a nucleus of
soldiers and trained officers in case of a war. By a law of
Congress, it was enacted that every sound and healthy man,
with a few exceptions in special cases, between the ages of 18
and 45, should be enrolled and equipped for military duty.
Then, by the laws of the States, they are required on certain
days in each year to meet in companies, regiments or brigades,
for drill and practice in military exercises.</p>

<p>4. By these means military organizations are kept up in every
part of the country, together with some knowledge of the military
art. These, in time of war or domestic insurrection, may
be called out with but a few days’ notice; and a large army of
citizen soldiers can be raised in a very short time. With such
facilities for raising men, it is unnecessary to keep a standing
army of much magnitude. A few thousand men to guard our
fortifications and military posts are sufficient.</p>

<p>The late civil war between the South and the North gave
ample evidence of this; for when it became necessary to raise
a million of men, it was done in a short time, and after a little
practice they became good soldiers.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MILITARY ACADEMY.</span></h4>

<p>1. The success of military affairs in time of war depends,
in great measure, on a thorough knowledge of the science of
war, and especially of engineering, so often requiring to be
applied with haste and accuracy to the <i>con</i>struction or <i>de</i>struction
of military defenses. It requires a complete knowledge
of certain branches of mathematics, and an understanding of
their application to warlike purposes. Various other special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
studies are required to prepare men for prompt and able action
in military operations. For the purpose of keeping a corps of
officers, well fitted to meet these requirements, ready for possible
occasions</p>

<h5>A MILITARY ACADEMY</h5>

<p class="noindent">was established. It is located on the west bank of the Hudson
river, at West Point, in the State of New York, and about 50
miles from the city of New York, and is one of the government
institutions. It had its origin in an act of Congress passed as
early as 1802. Under this act this far-famed military school
was commenced, but on a scale, in every respect, very much
inferior to what it has since become.</p>

<p>2. Its name explains its character and objects. It was
established and has been continued at a great expense, for the
purpose of teaching and training up young men in the science
and art of war, that in any emergency the country might have
a sufficient number of men, educated and skilled in all such
arts and sciences as appertain to war. Hence, mathematics,
engineering, gunnery, drawing, natural and experimental philosophy
and military tactics, are among the principal branches
taught. In all of these, able professors give instruction to the
cadets, as the pupils are called. Chemistry, geology, and the
French language are also taught at this institution. The
instruction is thorough, the discipline excellent, and some of
the graduates of this celebrated school rank high among the
scientific men of the country.</p>

<p>3. Congress controls and regulates this establishment, as it
does all other departments, institutions, and works belonging
to the government. It enacts all laws relating to its officers,
professors, and cadets, and to the management of the institution.</p>

<p>4. By a law passed in 1843, the number of cadets to be
admitted was made to correspond with the number of Senators
and Representatives from each State. Every State and
Territory is entitled to send as many cadets as it has Senators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and Representatives in Congress. This gives each Territory,
however, but one; as a Territory has no Senators, and but one
Representative. By the same law the District of Columbia is
allowed one. To give every part of the country an equal
chance, it was enacted that each Congressional district in each
State and Territory should be allowed to send one cadet, to be
educated at West Point. These are generally nominated for
appointment by the Congressmen from their respective districts,
and the President appoints. The cadet must be an
actual resident of the district for which he is appointed.</p>

<p>5. In addition to these, it is provided by the same act, that
ten more cadets may be appointed at large; <i>i. e.</i>, without
regard to Congressional districts. In order to be admitted as
a cadet, the candidate must be well versed in reading, writing,
and arithmetic; must not be under 14 nor over 21 years of
age; and must sign articles, agreeing to serve the United States
eight years. After he has finished his studies and has graduated,
he is considered as a candidate for a commission in the
army, according to the duties he may be competent to perform.</p>

<p>6. The Military Academy may be considered a branch of
the War Department. Men who have been educated there
have rendered the country signal service in times of war, have
made able commanders, and have proved themselves thoroughly
skilled in military science. Not only in the military service
has it been a benefit to the country, but in the civil walks of
life. Many of its graduates have distinguished themselves as
engineers, astronomers, and in other scientific professions and
useful employments.</p>

<p>7. There is an annual examination of the cadets, and of the
general affairs of the institution, by a committee appointed by
the President, for that purpose.</p>

<p>It is composed of Congressmen and military officers. It is
the duty of these examiners to attend the examination, inspect
its discipline, and course of instruction, look after its fiscal
affairs, and all other matters relating to the Academy, and report
the same to the Secretary of War, for the use of Congress.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">DEPOTS OF WAR MATERIAL.</span></h4>

<p>We have seen that the government can be sure of the support
of the citizens in time of war and that they furnish the
best kind of material of that description for military purposes.
An army of great effectiveness can be organized in a comparatively
short time, when important interests of the country are
at stake. Not so, however, with the arms they require to use
for offensive purposes. These require time and skilled workmen
to construct them. They are therefore kept in readiness
for use in Depots constructed for the purpose.</p>

<p>As early as 1794, Congress enacted that three or four arsenals
and magazines, with an armory attached to each, should
be established for the safe keeping of military stores. An arsenal
is a place where arms and military stores are kept. An
armory is a place where arms are made or repaired. The
armories where arms are manufactured are at Springfield, in
Massachusetts, and at Harpers’ Ferry, in Virginia. But
there are many others where they are repaired.</p>

<p>In 1808, the President was authorized to purchase sites and
to erect as many more arsenals and manufactories of arms as
he might deem expedient. Each of these establishments was
formerly under the direction of a superintendent; but they are
now placed under the direction of the Ordnance Department.
The office of superintendent of the armories at Springfield and
Harpers’ Ferry, was also abolished in 1842; and its duties
have since been performed by such officers of the ordnance
corps as were designated by the President. In each armory
there is employed a master armorer, who superintends the workmen.
In addition to those already named there are arsenals and
armories at Pittsburgh and Bridesburg, in Pennsylvania; at
Washington City; at Watervliet, in New York; Watertown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Mass.; at Columbus, Ohio; at Indianapolis, in Indiana; and at
Rock Island, in Illinois. They are parts of the military establishment
of the country, and belong to the War Department.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">ARTICLES OF WAR.</span></h4>

<p>1. An army is designed, in idea, to supply a powerful
instrument of offense and defense, that shall so thoroughly
organize and fuse together a large number of individuals that
the whole shall act as one, and be perfectly under the control
of the directing mind. An army fully realizing this idea,
would suppress, in its military acts, all thoughts and sentiments
of its individuals, and be used by its commanding general as he
would use his own hand, arm and foot. It should move at
his will, strike where, as long and as heavily as he saw best,
and be to him a perfect machine as to obedience.</p>

<p>2. This idea is seldom more than partially realized; but it
is the aim of all military drill, discipline, and law. The Articles
of War are the body of laws enacted by Congress defining
the relations of soldiers to their officers, so as to secure as fully as
possible among a free people this thorough subordination, defining
the conduct of the soldier toward his superior, prescribing
the duty of the officer, and securing as far as possible in connection
with such subordination the rights of the soldier.</p>

<p>3. They contain general directions concerning the organization,
enlistment, and discharge of men, rules for leaves of
absence, punishment for absence without leave, or for desertion,
and other penalties for conduct improper or criminal in a soldier.
Many of these rules are very strict and the penalties
severe, since a neglect to obey might endanger the safety of an
army or the country, or interfere with the most important
operations. War is a very exacting pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>4. It is relaxing also in some directions and rules are made
requiring, and often without effect, obedience to some of the
most common principles and practices of morality. It often
becomes quite impossible to enforce these amid the fierce excitement
and wild disorder of active warfare.</p>

<p>5. Offenses committed in the army are not tried before a
civil tribunal, but by a military court called a “Court Martial,”
for the guidance of which a special code of rules is prepared.
These are characterized by the brevity, decisiveness, and summary
action that is so important to the effectiveness of all military
affairs. The decisions of a court martial may impose all
punishments even to condemning a man to death; but they
are subject to modification, or commutation, or even may be
wholly set aside by the President of the United States, who is
Commander-in-Chief of the Army.</p>

<p>The Articles of War relate to all things important to the
welfare, effectiveness, and safety of an army, and aim to provide
for the comfort and protect the rights of the individual
as well as circumstances permit. They consist of one hundred
and one articles. The first one requires every officer in the
army to subscribe to them before he enters on his duties.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">MILITARY HOSPITALS AND ASYLUMS.</span></h4>

<p>1. It is plainly a dictate of humanity that a government
should provide for the comfort and skillful treatment of those
persons who are wounded in its service, or who become diseased
under the hardships of a military life and are disabled from
active duty. Our century is specially distinguished by the
benevolent care bestowed on the indigent and the suffering, in
all civilized countries, and we have reason to expect that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
United States would take a leading place in this care for her
own citizens.</p>

<p>2. This has been done, and all the thoughtful attention
that the case called for has been given to hospitals and
asylums for the disabled and suffering, both of the Army
and Navy, equally in peace and war.</p>

<p>3. In 1851, Congress passed an act for the establishment of
military asylums, for the purpose of making the same provision
for wounded and disabled soldiers as had already been
made for that class of seamen. These institutions are located
in different sections of the country where deemed most eligible
and convenient for those who need such a place of refuge.
They are placed under the government of a board of commissioners,
consisting of the general in chief, and eight other
military officers of high rank, who submit their acts to the
Secretary of War for his approval.</p>

<p>4. The officers of these asylums must be taken from the
army, and consist of a governor, a deputy governor, and secretary,
who is also treasurer. The funds for their support are
raised by a tax of twenty-five cents per month on the soldiers,
to which are added the fines and penalties adjudged against
soldiers by courts martial, with forfeitures for desertion, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Persons receiving pensions from the government may be
admitted into these asylums upon condition that they surrender
their pensions to the use of the institution while they
remain in it.</p>

<p>The commissioners are authorized to buy sites and buildings
for these institutions, and to receive donations of them. They
also furnish them with whatever is necessary for the comfort
of the inmates, and make such laws and regulations for their
government as they deem proper.</p>

<p>Deserters, mutineers, and habitual drunkards, are excluded
from the benefits of these asylums.</p>

<h5>INSANE ASYLUM.</h5>

<p>5. Among these benevolent institutions provided by a generous
government for the support of those who have faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
served their country, the insane asylum ought to be noticed.
The title of this establishment is “the government hospital for
the insane.” Its objects are the cure and kind treatment of
the insane of the army and navy, and of the District of Columbia.
It is under the control of a board of nine visitors, all of
whom must be citizens of the said District. They are appointed
by the President, and annually report to the Secretary of the
Interior the condition of the asylum and its inmates. They
serve without compensation.</p>

<p>6. The superintendent must be a physician. There is a
farm attached to the asylum, which is under the direction of
the superintendent, who receives patients upon the order of the
Secretary of the War, or the Navy, and upon the order of the
Secretary of the Interior. He may receive indigent insane
persons residing in the District of Columbia. If other than
indigent persons are admitted, they must pay for the privilege
a sum not less than the cost of their support.</p>

<p>7. The military hospitals in time of war are for temporary
purposes, and are established wherever the army happens to be,
and especially near where the great battles have been fought,
that immediate relief may be given to the sick and wounded.
These are established by the commanders of the army, and are
under their control. And here let it be recorded to their praise,
that since military hospitals were known, never have any been
seen which for order, cleanliness and efficiency in administering
to the comfort and care of the sick and wounded soldiers, surpassed
those of the United States during the late civil war.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">NAVY DEPARTMENT.</span></h4>

<p>The position of the United States naturally gives it great
prominence as a naval power. Situated between the two great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
oceans, with thousands of miles of coast on each, and a profusion
of good harbors, bays, and great rivers, accessible to
large ocean vessels for long distances into the interior; with a
soil of great fertility, and numerous and inexhaustible sources
of mineral wealth, besides all the conditions favorable to the
establishment and success of manufactures—it requires large
foreign markets for its various products, and an extensive commerce
is essential to its development. It should be, and perhaps
it is, the strongest naval power in the world.</p>

<p>The War of Independence was much increased in length and
difficulty by the want of a navy, the maritime resources of
England giving her a great superiority in striking suddenly,
and in force, at distant points.</p>

<p>It was natural, then, that so important an arm, for both
attack and defense, should be prepared to act with energy, and
this was one of the first cares of the new government; and so
efficient did this branch of national strength become in the
thirty years of peace, to the war of 1812 with England, that
the easiest and some of the most important successes of the
Americans, in that conflict, were on the sea.</p>

<p>The care of Naval affairs was, at first, committed to the Secretary
of War. In 1798 it was erected into a separate Department,
and a Secretary placed at its head. He was entitled to
a seat in the Cabinet, as one of the advisers of the President,
and received his appointment by nomination of the President
and concurrence of the Senate, in the same manner as the
Heads of other Departments.</p>

<p>As the President is the highest officer, in command, in the
Navy, he ranks as second, and acts under his direction. It is
his duty to procure naval stores and materials, and to oversee
the places where they are deposited; to attend to the construction,
equipment, armament, and employment of vessels of war,
to make out the commissions of naval officers; to see that
efficiency and discipline are maintained in the service; and to
assume the control of the movements of the vessels of war
that are kept cruising in every sea for the protection of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
commerce and citizens in foreign parts, and the preservation
of the international rights and dignity of the United States.</p>

<p>3. A chief clerk was formerly the second officer in rank in
the Department, but, in 1861, provision was made, by Congress,
for an Assistant Secretary, who should act as Secretary
in the absence of that officer.</p>

<p>Formerly there were five bureaus in this department, but in
1862, three more were added, making eight, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. A Bureau of Yards and Docks.</li>
<li>2. A Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting.</li>
<li>3. A Bureau of Navigation.</li>
<li>4. A Bureau of Ordnance.</li>
<li>5. A Bureau of Construction and Repairs.</li>
<li>6. A Bureau of Steam Engineering.</li>
<li>7. A Bureau of Provisions and Clothing.</li>
<li>8. A Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.</li>
</ul>

<p>The President and Senate appoint all the heads of these
bureaus, and select them principally from officers of high rank
in the navy. They are all appointed for four years.</p>

<p>The Secretary appoints all the numerous clerks employed in
the various bureaus and assigns their duties.</p>

<p>He must annually report to Congress the condition of his
department, the manner and amount of all expenditures, furnish
estimates for the expenses of the following year, and give
such advice in regard to the naval interests of the country as
his intimate knowledge of that branch of the service may suggest.
He requires an intimate knowledge of maritime affairs,
and of International law, and a high and enlightened appreciation
of the policy to be pursued in our official and commercial
intercourse with all foreign nations.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE UNITED STATES NAVY.</span></h4>

<p>1. The original thirteen States were all on the Atlantic
coast, and had each one or more sea ports. They were naturally
given to commerce, and the second Continental Congress,
in December, 1775, resolved to form a navy of thirteen vessels
of war. Eight were soon fitted out; but the superiority of
England on the sea, and the great financial difficulties with
which Congress had to struggle during, and for some years
after, the Revolutionary War, made it impossible to give any
great degree of development to naval affairs. The sea swarmed
with American privateers during the war, and many hundreds
of English merchant vessels were captured; but Congress never
was able to collect a formidable fleet. The daring exploits of
Paul Jones, in European waters, and the bold and successful
raids of Privateersmen under Letters of Marque and
Reprisal gave indication of what might be looked for in the
future, but they could not cope with British fleets.</p>

<p>2. The Navy Department was for some time under the control
of the Secretary of War; but, as the finances began to
improve, care was taken to develop this important branch of
national power, and a special Secretary appointed. In the war
of 1812 with England 25 years of peace had unfitted the people
for great <i>immediate</i> success in the army; but the navy was
the pride and glory of the nation. The disasters attending military
operations for the first year or two were more than compensated
by the brilliant and solid advantages gained by our
men of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>3. This gave a great impulse to the naval tendencies of the
nation, and it soon became the settled determination of the
people to supersede England as the strongest naval power. She
had been <i>Mistress</i> of the Seas; there were strong reasons for
our ambition to become <i>Masters</i>, at least in American waters.
We had an extensive line of coast, and our “Monroe Doctrine,”
that Americans ought to rule America, and that European
governments should never be permitted to acquire a preponderating
influence in North America, rendered a strong navy
important. Our people, however, are so largely commercial
that skillful mariners are always at command; and the government
has never maintained, in time of peace, a very large naval
force.</p>

<p>4. What they can do in time of need was demonstrated
during the Civil War, when the navy was increased in two
years by more than 400 vessels—many of them very expensive
and powerful; proving in actual conflict the inability of the
strongest land fortresses to resist them. The thousands of
miles of the Atlantic and Gulf coast blockade, that was rendered
so effective as to <i>smother</i> the Confederate government,
so to speak, destroying its finances by rendering its cotton
unavailable, is the best comment on the naval resources of the
United States. The extreme boldness and vigor with which
the Confederate cruisers that managed to escape the blockade
fell on our merchant vessels, and laid waste our commerce, is
another point in the argument; for they were Americans, and
demonstrated the natural prowess of Americans on the sea,
of which we could well be proud but that it did fatal harm to
our mercantile marine.</p>

<p>5. Not half of the vessels belonging to the navy are, however,
now (in time of peace) in commission—that is, in active
service. The rest are either laid up, or in process of repair.
Most of those in commission are employed in what is called
squadron service. The Secretary of the Navy in a late report
enumerates seven of these squadrons; viz.: the European, the
Asiatic, the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Pacific, the South Pacific, and the Gulf squadrons. The names
given to these squadrons indicate their whereabouts, and their
cruising grounds. These squadrons consist of six, eight, ten,
twelve or fifteen vessels, as the work to be done may require.
It is their duty to visit the seaports of the various countries
along the coasts of which they cruise, in order to protect our
merchantmen against pirates or enemies of any description,
which may molest them or interfere with their rights and privileges;
and also to look after the interests and dignity of the
United States.</p>

<p>6. The squadrons are under command of a high naval officer
of the rank of commodore or rear admiral, whose ship is
called the flag ship of the squadron. Many of our naval officers
have distinguished themselves for bravery, skill, and patriotic
devotion to their country, and have occupied the highest
positions of honor, and the most exalted places in the esteem
and affection of their countrymen.</p>

<p>In 1862, Congress enacted that there should be nine grades
of officers in the navy, and that their corresponding rank with
military officers should be as follows:</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">NAVY YARDS.</span></h4>

<p>1. We have seen that the Secretary of the Navy has several
different Bureaus, having each its separate part of naval interests
and stores to care for. The material for the equipment of
the army is, in large part, stored in arsenals and armories; in the
navy in or near Navy Yards. Here are gathered such stores
and materials as are required for the construction or repairs of
vessels, and hundreds of skilled workmen, constantly employed
in rendering the navy effective; replacing vessels that have
become unseaworthy, repairing damages, or building such
vessels of special construction as the varying demands of the
service may require.</p>

<p>2. These are established at different places along the coast,
most convenient for the purpose. There is one at Philadelphia,
Pa., at Brooklyn, N. Y., at Portsmouth, Va., at Pensacola, Fla.
Here vessels are laid up when not in “commission” or active
service, or are sent for repairs, or to obtain their stores before
departing to their distant stations. All the officers necessary
for keeping all these matters in order are stationed at these
yards; and the Navy Department, by these means, preserves
the same perfect system of organization and efficiency as we
have seen to characterize other branches of the executive
administration.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NAVAL ACADEMY.</span></h4>

<p>1. Naval affairs, quite as much as military, perhaps even
more, require the aids of science, and a careful and thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
training. Much of this, indeed, is gained in active service,
but for this a basis of scientific study must be laid, and this
school of preliminary instruction is called the Naval Academy.
As a preliminary even to this, the government has established
schools on board of ships, for the instruction of boys in navigation
and naval warfare. These are called apprentices; and
for good conduct and proficiency in their studies, they are
advanced to the Naval Academy, and placed in the line of promotion.</p>

<p>2. This school is now established at Annapolis, in the State
of Maryland, near Washington. Like the Military Academy,
it has its superintendent and professors. The pupils are called
midshipmen. They are taught navigation and such other
branches of science as are necessary to make them good seamen
and naval officers. They are selected upon nearly the
same plan as cadets. Each Congressional District in every
State and Territory is entitled to send two students to be
educated at the Academy. The District of Columbia is also
entitled to send two. Besides which, the President is allowed
to appoint ten additional ones at large, and three more from
the boys enlisted in the navy.</p>

<p>3. After their graduating examination, if they pass, they
are commissioned as ensigns in the navy, and rank according
to merit. Before admission, they are examined according to
the regulations made by the Secretary of the Navy, and must
be between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years, sound,
robust, and of good constitution.</p>

<p>4. The course of study in this, as well as in the Military
Academy, is adapted to the profession which the students are
expected to follow—the one in the navy, the other in the army.
More are educated at these great national schools than the
government needs in time of peace. Many of the graduates are
engaged in civil employment. Thus these institutions have
been of great service to the country, outside of the army and
navy, for they have added to the number of well-educated and
scientific men, who may be useful in any of the walks of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Their graduates elevate the standard of intelligence in the
community, especially when they engage in the work of instruction.</p>

<p>Both of these institutions are supported at the expense of the
government. The tuition and board of cadets in one, and of
the midshipmen in the other, costs them nothing.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY.</span></h4>

<p>1. An observatory is a building erected for astronomical
purposes, and supplied with the necessary apparatus for studying
the heavens. A thorough knowledge of certain portions
of astronomy is indispensable to the commander of a vessel,
since it is by means of this alone that he can ascertain his
exact position on the open ocean out of sight of land. Nautical
Science and Astronomy have advanced hand in hand; and
to perfect the former as much as possible the United States
Government established the Naval Observatory. This institution
is located in Washington, and was originated by act of
Congress in 1842, and put in operation in 1844.</p>

<p>2. This institution owes more to that enlightened and truly
patriotic President, John Q. Adams, than to any other man.
He recommended it as far back as 1823, and again in his first
message to Congress. But political opposition to the man
prevented his recommendations from being acted upon till
nearly 20 years after they were made. This opposition was
finally overcome, and we, and posterity after us, will reap the
fruits of Mr. Adams’ suggestions and labors.</p>

<p>3. The observatory was built and furnished with various
astronomical and philosophical instruments, and a corps of
professors were appointed to watch the movements of the
heavenly bodies, and to make such observations and experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
as would enable them to determine many unsettled
questions which relate to the science of navigation; and incidentally
to another great government work, having especial
reference to the same subject; that is, the coast survey.</p>

<p>The coast survey has already been of great service to the
interests of navigation—whether national or commercial vessels
are regarded—and, when finished, much greater benefits
are to be expected. When a sufficient number of observations
and experiments shall have been made at the naval observatory,
and published to the world, much valuable information
will be added to what is already known. And indeed it would
be disreputable to a nation having so large a navy and such a
vast number of merchant ships upon the ocean, to do nothing
for or add nothing to the science of navigation. It would be
an unwise policy if economy only were studied, and we would
justly deserve the reproach of being penurious, short-sighted,
and miserably wanting in disposition to promote the general
good of the world.</p>

<p>4. The professors are assiduous in their labors, and publish
the results of their observations and the facts they have determined.
These are not only of use to our own seamen, but to
those of all nations who are doing business on the great deep.
Here the charts made by the coast survey are deposited, and
from hence all our national vessels are furnished with them,
and with all the nautical instruments they require.</p>

<p>The charts, instruments and books relating to astronomy
and navigation, found here, make it the headquarters and depot
of nautical science in the United States.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE COAST SURVEY.</span></h4>

<p>1. While the Naval Observatory is a government institution
for studying the heavens in the interest of the Navy; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Coast Survey is an organization employed in a thorough and
scientific study of the shores of our country for a sufficient
distance out from the land to ascertain all the features concealed
by the water that may have a bearing on the safety of
our navy and commerce. One examines the heavens, the other
the depths of the waters. They are both of great importance.</p>

<p>2. This government undertaking has not been as vigorously
prosecuted as some other enterprises conducted by it. As
early as 1807, Congress passed an act authorizing the President
to have this work done. Much of it has been done, yet it is
not finished at this day. Our acquisition of Florida, Texas,
and California has greatly extended our sea coast since the
work was commenced, and its accomplishment has cost more
time and labor than was anticipated at the beginning, yet we
think it ought to have been completed in much less than 60
years.</p>

<p>3. This work, like that relating to light houses, is under the
management of a board, consisting of a superintendent, two
principal assistants, two naval officers, and four officers of the
army. These nine constitute the board. Then there are as
many officers of the army and navy employed in the execution
of the work as are deemed necessary. And the public vessels,
by direction of the President, may be used in order to facilitate
the work, for much of it must be done at sea. The survey
extends 20 leagues from the shore. The surveyors must make
accurate charts of the whole coast, in which are laid down all
the islands, shoals, roads or anchorage grounds within twenty
leagues of any part of the shore of the United States. The
courses or distances between the principal capes or headlands
must be laid down, together with the soundings (depths of
water) and everything else necessary to make a complete and
accurate chart of every part of our coasts.</p>

<p>4. An annual report of this work must be made to Congress
in December of each year, accompanied with charts,
showing the progress of the work, the number of persons
employed, the expenses incurred, the amount of work finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and what is unfinished. These reports and charts are carefully
preserved, and copies of them may be had at Washington for
the use of our naval and merchant ships, to which they are of
great service, as guides, whenever they are on or near the coast.
This work, in its utility, is not confined to ourselves; but the
important information obtained by it is of great use to the
navigators of all nations who come into our ports or cruise on
our coasts. They derive the same benefits from this work that
we derive from theirs of the same kind. It is creditable to
any nation to do such things as are beneficial to the world,
such acts as contribute to the welfare of humanity. Shipwrecks
belong to the list of terrible calamities which often befall those
“who go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
waters.” Whoever diminishes these is a public benefactor.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">LIGHT HOUSES.</span></h4>

<p>1. These, with Buoys, and Beacons, are a necessary practical
supplement to the labors of the Coast Survey. Buoys and
Beacons indicate the shoals, or dangerous rocks and reefs
beneath the surface of the water, in the daytime; while light
houses indicate the same, and show the mariner the bearings
of the land, in the night; and, by studying, in connection with
these, the charts of the coast supplied by the Coast Survey, he
may make his way as securely in the night or day through the
concealed dangers of the treacherous waters as a landsman
along a beaten highway. They are way-marks along the sea
coast, at the entrance of harbors, and on lakes and rivers.
They speak a language very well understood by the seaman;
and are invaluable for the protection of his vessel from the
dangers of the Deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Keepers are appointed by the government to keep them
in repair, and to see that they are properly lighted every night.
We have no means of knowing the number of these useful
establishments, but there must be several hundred of them; for
we have more sea coast than any other nation upon the globe,
with a still greater length of lake and river shore. They are
located at prominent points, and at dangerous places, all along
the extensive lines of coast and shores.</p>

<p>3. To the end that light houses should be constructed and
kept in repair, and that competent men might have the whole
matter in charge, a law of 1852 authorized the President to
appoint two officers of the navy of high rank, one officer of
the corps of engineers of the army, one officer of the topographical
engineers, and two civilians of high scientific attainments,
to form a <span class="smcap">light house board</span> for the United States.
This board is attached to the Treasury Department, and the
Secretary of the Treasury superintends its operations. The
board has in charge the building, illumination, and inspection
of light houses, light vessels, buoys, beacons, sea marks, and
their appendages.</p>

<p>4. The Secretary of the Treasury is president of the board,
and may convene them whenever he deems it necessary.</p>

<p>The law makes it the duty of the board to divide the whole
of the sea, gulf, and lake coasts, into light house districts; not
exceeding 12 in number. An officer of the army or navy is
assigned to each district, as a light house inspector.</p>

<p>They have the control of everything relating to light houses,
light ships, buoys, beacons, or other means of directing vessels
in and out of port, or of guiding them while sailing along the
coast in the night.</p>

<p>5. As foreign vessels receive the same benefits from our
light houses as our own, there is nothing unfair or illiberal in
requiring them to contribute something towards the expense
of maintaining them. For this purpose Congress has imposed
a tax, or laid a duty of 50 cents per ton on all foreign vessels
entering any ports of the United States. This is called “<span class="smcap">light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
money</span>.” It is collected in the same way as tonnage duties
are, <i>i. e.</i>, by the collector of the port where the ship arrives.
Light money is not required of vessels owned by citizens of
the United States, provided that they are regularly registered
as the law directs, or have a sea letter.</p>

<p>7. A sea letter is a document or certificate, given by the
collector of a port, to the captain of an American vessel, certifying
that she belongs to a citizen or citizens of the United
States. Armed with this, the captain can prove to all whom it
may concern, anywhere in the world, the ownership and
nationality of his vessel. This is a protection to her and her
cargo, especially in times of war. It is one of a ship’s papers.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">LETTERS OF MARQUE AND REPRISAL.</span></h4>

<p>1. The somewhat barbarous custom has prevailed among
nations, from early times, of making war in every possible way
upon the citizens of a hostile country, and of taking or destroying
their property, on the principle that injury to the citizens
of the power warred against would diminish its power of
defense and attack.</p>

<p>This has been carried into effect on the sea by authorizing
private vessels to be fitted out for warlike purposes and preying
on the commerce of the enemy. Such authority is given by
Letters of Marque and Reprisal. The Constitution confers on
Congress the power to do this; and Congress authorizes the
President to do it. A law was passed in 1863 expressly conveying
it to him.</p>

<p>2. It is a formal commission given to the commander of a
private armed vessel, called a privateer, authorizing him to
capture the ships and goods of the subjects of a nation with
which we are at war. When such letters are issued by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
United States they are signed by the President and sealed with
the great seal. Without such commission, thus signed and
sealed, any capture made by the commander of a private vessel
would be piracy. If a capture is made, it must be made according
to the laws of war, as recognized by civilized nations, and
according to the instructions given by the President. Any
conduct on the part of a privateer, contrary to these rules,
would vitiate his proceedings, and he would not be entitled to
the property he had captured.</p>

<p>3. The captured vessel is called a prize, and must be taken
into some port of the United States, or into some port of a
country in amity with the United States, where legal proceedings
are taken before some court of competent jurisdiction;
and the capture and all the circumstances of it inquired into;
and if all is found to have been done according to the laws of
civilized nations, the captured vessel and cargo is condemned
as a prize. But if not condemned, the captors lose her. When
adjudged to be a lawful prize, the ship and cargo are sold, and
the money is divided between the officers and men, according to
rank, and according to the laws of Congress on this subject.
These laws give the whole to the captors, when the ship taken
is of equal or superior force to the ship making the capture;
but if of inferior force, then the United States takes one-half.</p>

<p>4. Privateering, as this business is called, was once considered
a lawful and honorable mode of warfare. It was generally
practiced between belligerent nations; but in later days its
propriety and morality have been questioned. It is beginning
to be looked upon as a kind of robbery not very distantly
related to piracy. That it is robbery no one can deny, and,
query, “Can it be justified on the ground that the robber and
the robbed are the subjects of nations at war with each other?”</p>

<p>5. In Europe an effort has been made to do away with this
species of warfare. We hope it will yet succeed, and that all
nations will agree to abolish this system of plunder. Innocent
parties are generally the sufferers, while but small injury is
done to the power of the hostile nation.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smaller">NAVY AND MARINE HOSPITALS.</span></h4>

<p>1. These institutions are still more important for sailors
than for soldiers; as the sailor is more likely to have lost his
adaptation to any kind of business on land, and to lose sight
of family relations by reason of his long absences to foreign
regions. The government very early took this subject in hand
and made ample, and extremely comfortable, provision for disabled
seamen belonging to its navy.</p>

<p>2. In 1811 an act was passed to establish navy hospitals, for
the exclusive use of such seamen as belonged to the navy. This
new institution was at first placed under the management of a
board of commissioners known as the commissioners of navy
hospitals. This commission consisted of the Secretaries of the
Navy, Treasury, and War. But in 1832 this was changed, and
the Secretary of the Navy was made sole trustee of the navy
hospital fund, which was made up of $50,000 appropriated by
Congress for that purpose, together with twenty cents per month
collected from seamen belonging to the navy, and the fines
imposed on navy officers, seamen, and marines.</p>

<p>The commissioners were authorized to purchase or erect
suitable buildings for navy hospitals.</p>

<h5>THE MARINE HOSPITALS.</h5>

<p>3. These are located near important seaports. At these
places seamen depart for, and arrive from their voyages, and
are found in the greatest numbers; and here the funds for the
support of the marine hospitals are collected, as is the tonnage
on ships, viz.: by the collectors of the ports. For this purpose
the law authorizes the collectors of customs to demand and
receive the sum of twenty cents per month from the wages of
every sailor; and every master of a vessel is obliged to render
to the collector an accurate account of the number of seamen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
on board his vessel, and of the time they have been employed
by him, since his last entry into any port of the United States.
These twenty cents the captain must pay the collector, but he
is allowed to deduct it from each seaman’s wages. In this
manner the funds for the building, furnishing, and support of
the marine hospitals are raised. The collectors of the ports
pay them into the United States Treasury, and the Treasurer
disburses them to the directors of the hospitals as they are
needed. The directors are appointed by the President. They
appropriate the funds, and have the general direction and management
of the institutions.</p>

<p>4. These provisions are contained in an act entitled, “An
act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen,” passed in 1798.
Seamen, whether in the merchant service or in the naval service
of the United States, were indiscriminately taxed for the support
of these hospitals; and both have the same rights, privileges
and benefits in them. The money thus collected from
seamen is called “hospital money,” and the fund is denominated
“the marine hospital fund.” In 1864 there were 24
marine hospitals in the United States.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.</span></h4>

<p>1. At the first general census, in 1790, there were but little
over three millions and a half of inhabitants in the United
States, and these mostly settled along the Atlantic seaboard;
the country was oppressed with debt, and not recovered from
the effects of a desolating war. Its public business, therefore,
was comparatively small in amount, and was readily managed
by the three Departments, of State, of the Treasury, and of
War. The energy of the people, and the great resources at
their command, enabled them to surmount all their difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
in a short time, and the country entered on a career of remarkable
prosperity. Its public business kept pace with the general
expansion, and new departments were from time to time
created, to improve the efficiency of the public service.</p>

<p>2. In 1849 Congress passed a law creating the Department of
the Interior, and a Secretary of the Interior, having a seat in
the Cabinet, appointed in the same manner, and possessing the
same rank, as the other members of the Cabinet, was installed
in office.</p>

<p>3. The bureau of the Commissioner of Patents was transferred
from the Department of State, and the General Land Office
from that of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The supervisory power before exercised by the Secretary
of the Treasury over the accounts of the marshals, clerks,
and other officers of all the courts of the United States,
was placed in the hands of the new Secretary. The office
of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, heretofore attached to
the War Department, was also transferred to this; and the
powers and duties of the Secretary of War, in relation to Indian
affairs, were devolved on the Secretary of the Interior.</p>

<p>4. The Secretaries of War and of the Navy were by the
same act relieved of their duties in regard to the Commissioner
of Pensions, and those duties were thereafter to be performed
by the Secretary of the new department.</p>

<p>The Census Bureau, heretofore attached to the State Department,
and the duties of the Secretary of State in relation
thereto, were also transferred to this department.</p>

<p>To the Secretary was also given the supervisory power over
the lead and other mines belonging to the United States, heretofore
executed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The powers of the President over the Commissioners of
Public Buildings were also transferred to him.</p>

<p>5. He was also charged with the control over the Board of
Inspectors and Warden of the Penitentiary of the District of
Columbia.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Interior has the same power in appointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and removing clerks and other subordinates in his department,
that the Secretaries of the other departments had over
these several bureaus before they were transferred to this
department.</p>

<p>This office has a seal, which must be affixed to the commissions
of all its subordinate officers.</p>

<p>The President and Senate appoint the Assistant Secretaries.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it is easy to understand what branches
of the public service are conducted in this office, and what are
the duties of its Secretary.</p>

<p>6. The following is a list of all who have filled the office
of Secretary of the Interior since the establishment of the
department:</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">PUBLIC LANDS.</span></h4>

<p>1. ALL the land in the United States, to which individuals
or corporations have not acquired a legal title, is held by the
general government. This includes the land, or the part of it
not under special reservation, belonging to the Indians. As
the settlements push on into the territory roamed over by the
thinly scattered Indian tribes, an equitable arrangement is
made with them, by which certain Reservations, large enough
for their purposes are set aside for their occupation; and an
indemnity, commonly in the form of an annuity, is made
them for the lands to which they renounce their right. As
they are gradually melting away, their lands will soon become
all, or nearly all, the property of the government.</p>

<p>2. The lands free for settlement are sold under certain regulations;
and given to certain classes—to soldiers, to actual
settlers for Homesteads, to corporations to aid in promoting the
public welfare—as Railroads and Colleges—and to support education
in various ways; and the remainder held until required
for use in the expansion of the country.</p>

<p>Nearly 200,000,000 acres have been given to assist in building
railroads through unsettled parts of the country. A large
part of this, however, has been only conditionally given, and
not yet appropriated by the corporations. Many millions more
have been given to the States as a fund in aid of public schools
and collegiate institutions—and one thirty-sixth part is
reserved, in every new township surveyed, for the benefit of
public schools in that township. The rest is sold, at very
low rates, to any who will buy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>3. To manage this property a bureau was established by
act of Congress, in 1812, called The General Land Office. It
was under the oversight of the Secretary of the Treasury until
1849, when the Department of the Interior was established, to
which it was then transferred. Its head is called</p>

<h5>COMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE.</h5>

<p>4. He is appointed by the President and Senate, must take
the usual official oath before entering on his duties, and must
give the usual official bond. He keeps the seal of his office,
and fixes an impression of it upon all papers emanating from
the Land Office. He, with his clerks and assistants, forms the
bureau, keeps all the records and papers pertaining to the
public lands, and performs all duties relating thereto. He
receives reports from surveyors and from the district land
officers, gives them their instructions, and reports to the President
and to Congress when required to do so.</p>

<p>He issues all patents for lands granted by the United States,
and sends and receives by mail all papers and documents relating
to his official business, at public expense. Every patent
for land is issued in the name of the United States, is signed
by the President and by the Commissioner of the Land Office,
and is then recorded in books kept for that purpose.</p>

<h5>SURVEYORS GENERAL AND DEPUTY SURVEYORS.</h5>

<p>5. When it is deemed necessary and expedient to bring the
lands in any particular State or section of the country into
market, a surveyor general is appointed for that State or section,
and also a sufficient number of deputy or assistant surveyors
to perform the work; which is done under the direction
of the surveyor general, who is himself directed by law as to
the manner of procedure. He is appointed for four years,
taking the usual oath, and gives bonds for the faithful performance
of his duties.</p>

<h5>MODE OF SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS.</h5>

<p>6. The law directs how the lands shall be surveyed and
mapped. Where it is practicable, they are laid out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
square miles, each of which contains 640 acres, and is called a
section.</p>

<p>These sections are then sub-divided into halves, quarters, and
eighths of sections; that is, into lots of 320, 160, and 80 acres.
The boundary lines are all run north and south, and east and
west. Thirty-six of these sections, which make a plat of six
miles square, are put into a township. These townships are
designated by numbers, but when inhabited are named by the
inhabitants as their fancy dictates.</p>

<h5>SALE OF THE PUBLIC LANDS.</h5>

<p>7. After the lands have been surveyed and properly mapped
into townships and sections, they are brought into market and
offered for sale in such quantities as are wanted by the purchaser;
from 40 acres, one-sixteenth of a section, up to a
whole section; or as many sections as the buyer pleases to
take.</p>

<h5>DISTRICT LAND OFFICES.</h5>

<p>8. District land offices for the sale of lands are established
for this purpose at as many places in the State or Territory
where the lands are situated, as is deemed necessary for the
convenience of purchasers. Here are kept maps of all the
lands lying in the district, and buyers may make their selections
both of quantity and location as suits them. Here they
will find</p>

<h5>A REGISTER OF THE LAND OFFICE AND A RECEIVER OF PUBLIC
MONEY FOR LANDS.</h5>

<p>9. The first named officer will register the application
made for land in a book kept for that purpose, and the second
will receive the money paid for it. These officers are appointed
by the President and Senate, and report their proceedings to
the General Land Office at Washington. The receiver transmits
all moneys received by him to the United States Treasury
once in a month or once in three months, as directed.</p>

<h5>SCHOOL LANDS.</h5>

<p>10. As before stated, the public lands are surveyed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
sections of one mile square, and thirty-six of these sections
make a township. For the purpose of encouraging education,
Congress has enacted that section number 16, in every township,
shall not be sold, but reserved for the township, to be
applied to the support of common schools in that town. By
this measure the government appropriated one thirty-sixth
part of its lands to aid the work of educating the children in
the new States. And in addition to this it has made other
munificent donations of land for the establishment and support
of colleges and other institutions of learning.</p>

<p>11. In addition to all this the United States have donated
large tracts of land to the several States in which it lay, to aid
them in building their State houses, &amp;c. Large quantities of
land have also been given to aid the construction of railroads.</p>

<h5>HOMESTEADS.</h5>

<p>12. The government has always sold its lands at a very low
price, preferring to give the people cheap farms, rather than to
raise more revenue from this source.</p>

<p>But in 1862, Congress passed an act called “the Homestead
Law,” the object of which was to cheapen the public lands to
a mere nominal price to heads of families, male or female, or
to persons 21 years of age or over, or to persons who had
served in the army or navy of the United States, whether 21
years old or not. By the provisions of this act such persons
are allowed, for the trifling sum of ten dollars, to enter upon
and claim 160 acres of land, provided the claimant swears that
the land is applied for his or her own use, and for settlement
and cultivation. But no patent (deed) is to be given until the
applicant has actually settled upon and cultivated the land for
the space of five years. Such applicant must also make affidavit
that he has never borne arms against the United States.</p>

<p>By this liberal policy, persons of very limited means may
provide themselves with comfortable homes for life; and the
unoccupied lands will be settled and occupied faster than if
the old price of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
been demanded. The revenue from the sale of lands will of
course be less, but the wealth of the country will undoubtedly
be increased by the measure.</p>

<p>13. Exceedingly rich and valuable mines of gold, silver,
copper, lead and other minerals have been found upon the public
lands. That the benefits of mining them might be
extended to the many, instead of being monopolized by a few,
a different rule for selling them has been made. After they
have been surveyed, mapped and described, they, like other
lands, are offered for sale, but in quantities of not more than
40 acres. These are generally sold at auction, but no bid less
than five dollars per acre will be received. If not sold at public
sale, they are then subject to private sale at that price.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW TO SECURE PUBLIC LANDS.</span></h4>

<p>There are two classes of public lands subject to entry; one
at $1.25 per acre, known as <i>minimum</i>, and one at $2.50, known
as <i>double minimum</i>, the latter being the alternate sections
along the lines of railroads. Title may be acquired by purchase
at public sale, or by “private entry,” and in virtue of
the Pre-emption and Homestead Laws.</p>

<p><i>At Public Sale.</i>—Lands are offered at auction to the highest
bidder, pursuant to proclamation or public notice.</p>

<p><i>Private Entry.</i>—Lands subject to private entry, are those
which have been once offered at public sale without finding
purchasers. In order to acquire title to these lands, a written
application must be made to the Land Register of the District
in which the land is located, describing the tract desired. The
Register certifies the fact to the Receiver, stating price, and the
applicant then pays the money and takes a receipt, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
close of the month the Register and Receiver make return of
the sale to the General Land Office, when a patent or full title
issues on due surrender of the receipt, and will be delivered at
the option of the purchaser, at the General Land Office in
Washington, or by the Register at the District Land Office.</p>

<p><i>Land Warrants.</i>—When lands are to be located with land
warrants, application must be made as in cash cases, accompanied
by an assigned warrant. When the tract is $2.50 per acre,
$1.25 per acre must be paid in addition to the warrant.
Receipts are given and patents delivered, as in the preceding
case. At the time of location, a fee of 50 cents for a 40 acre
warrant, and a corresponding amount for larger ones, must be
paid to the Register, and a like sum to the Receiver.</p>

<p><i>Agricultural College Scrip.</i>—This may be used in the location
of lands at private entry, but is only applicable to lands
subject to entry at $1.25 per acre, and is restricted to a technical
“quarter section,” and to three sections in each township
of land. The proceeding to acquire title is the same as in
cash and warrant cases, the fees being the same as on warrants.
This scrip may be used in payment of pre-emption claims.</p>

<p><i>Pre-emption.</i>—Any person being the head of a family, or
widow, or single man over 21 years of age, and a citizen of the
United States, or a person who has filed his declaration to
become such, by settling upon and improving any of the
“offered,” “unoffered,” or unsurveyed lands of the United
States, may obtain a pre-emption right to purchase 160 acres
so occupied, at the regular government price, whether it be
$1.25 or $2.50 per acre. Where the tract is “offered” land,
the settler must file with the District Land Office his statement
as to the fact of settlement, within thirty days thereafter,
and within one year must make proof to the Land Office, of
his actual residence and cultivation, and secure the land by
payment in cash or Land Warrant. Where the land has been
surveyed and not offered at public sale, the statement must be
filed within three months after settlement, and payment made
within 21 months. Where settlement is made upon unsurveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
lands, the settler is required to file a statement within
three months after the survey, and pay within eighteen months
thereafter. No person is entitled to more than one pre-emption
right.</p>

<p><i>The Homestead Privilege.</i>—The Homestead laws give to
every citizen the right to a Homestead of 160 acres minimum,
or eighty acres double minimum. To obtain Homestead,
applicant must swear that he is the head of a family, or over
the age of twenty-one, a citizen, or has declared his intention
to become such; and that the entry is for his exclusive use and
benefit, and for actual settlement and cultivation. When an
applicant has made actual settlement upon the land he desires,
he must make affidavit of the fact before the Land Register,
and pay fees amounting, on 160 acres of minimum land, to $18,
or an equal sum for eighty acres of double minimum, for which
he gets a receipt; and after five years’ occupation and cultivation
of the land, he is entitled upon proof of such cultivation
to a patent or full title to the Homestead. Any loyal person
in the naval or military service of the United States, may
acquire a Homestead by reason of his family occupying land
and making the application in his stead. All officers, soldiers,
and sailors who have served in the army or navy for ninety
days and remained loyal, may enter 160 instead of 80 acres of
double minimum lands. The fees above for entering Homestead
apply to surveyed lands in Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa,
Missouri, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois. In California, Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico,
Washington Territory, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming,
and Montana, the fees are $22 instead of $18. A settler having
filed a pre-emption declaration, may change his filing into
Homestead, and receive the benefit of the Homestead laws. If
a Homestead settler does not wish to remain five years on his
land before obtaining title, he may pay for it in cash or Land
Warrants. Lands obtained under the Homestead laws are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
exempt from liability for debts contracted prior to the issuing
of the patent.</p>

<h5>PRE-EMPTION LAWS.</h5>

<p>A pre-emption right is the right of a squatter upon the
lands of the United States to purchase, in preference to others,
when the land is sold. Such right is granted to the following
persons: Any citizen of the United States; any person who has
filed his declaration of intention to become a citizen; any head
of a family; any widow; any single woman of the age of
twenty-one years or over; and any person who has made a settlement,
erected a dwelling-house upon, and is an inhabitant
of the tract sought to be entered—<i>provided</i> such settlement
was made since June 1, 1840, and previously to the time of
application for the land, which land must, at the date of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
settlement, have had the Indian title extinguished, and been
surveyed by the United States.</p>

<p>A person bringing himself within the above requirements
by proof satisfactory to the Register and Receiver of the land
district in which the land may lie, taken pursuant to the rules
hereafter prescribed, will, after having taken the affidavit
required by the Act, be entitled to enter, by legal subdivisions,
any number of acres, not exceeding one hundred and sixty, or
a quarter-section, to include his residence; and he may avail
himself of the same at any time prior to the day of the commencement
of the public sale, including said tract, where the
land has not yet been proclaimed.</p>

<p>Where the land was subject to private entry, June 1, 1840,
and a settlement shall thereafter be made upon such land, or
where the land shall become hereafter subject to private entry,
and after that period a settlement shall be made, which the
settler is desirous of securing, notice of such intention must
be given within thirty days after such settlement; and, in all
such cases, the proof, affidavit and payment must be made
within twelve months after such settlement.</p>

<p>The tracts liable to entry are embraced under the following
designations: <i>First</i>, a regular quarter-section, notwithstanding
the quantity may vary a few acres from one hundred and sixty;
or a quarter-section, which, though fractional in quantity by
the passage of a navigable stream through the same, is still
bounded by regular sectional and quarter-sectional lines; <i>second</i>,
a fractional section containing not over one hundred and sixty
acres, or any tract being a detached or anomalous survey made
pursuant to law, and not exceeding such quantity; <i>third</i>, two
adjoining half-quarter-sections (in all cases to be separated by
a north and south line, except on the north side of township,
where the surveys are so made as to throw the excess or deficiency
on the north and west sides of the township), of the
regular quarters mentioned in the first designation; <i>fourth</i>,
two half-quarter or eighty-acre subdivisions of a fractional or
broken section, adjoining each other, the aggregate quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres; <i>fifth</i>, a regular
half-quarter and an adjoining fractional section, or an adjoining
half-quarter subdivision of a fractional section, the aggregate
quantity not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres; <i>sixth</i>,
if the pre-emptor do not wish to enter one hundred and sixty
acres, he may enter a single half-quarter section (made by a
north and south line), or an eighty-acre subdivision of a fractional
section; <i>seventh</i>, one or more adjoining forty-acre lots
may be entered, the aggregate not exceeding one hundred and
sixty acres; and, <i>eighth</i>, a regular half-quarter, a half-quarter
subdivision, or a fractional section, may each be taken, with
one or more forty-acre subdivisions lying adjoining, the aggregate
not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres. Forty-acre
tracts, or quarter quarter-sections, may be entered in the same
manner that eighty-acre, or half-quarter sections, have been.</p>

<p>Only one person upon a quarter-section is protected, and he
the one who made the first settlement, provided he conform to
the other provisions of the law. A person who has once availed
himself of the provisions of the Pre-emption Act, cannot, at
any future period, or at any other land office, acquire any other
right under it. No person, who is the proprietor of three
hundred and twenty acres of land in any State or Territory of
the United States, or who quits or abandons his residence on
his own land to reside on the public land in the same State or
Territory, is entitled to the benefit of the Pre-emption Acts.</p>

<p>The approval of the tracts by the local land office is the evidence
of the survey; but the land is to be construed as surveyed
when the requisite lines are run on the field, and the corners
established by the deputy surveyor. No assignment or transfers
of pre-emption rights are recognized at the land office; the
patents issuing to the claimants, in whose names alone the entries
are made.</p>

<p>The following description of lands are not liable to entry:
<i>first</i>, lands included in any reservation by any treaty, law, or
proclamation of the President of the United States, and lands
reserved for salines and for other purposes; <i>second</i>, lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
reserved for the support of schools; <i>third</i>, lands acquired by
either of the last two treaties with the Miami Indians in Indiana,
or which may be acquired of the Wyandot Indians in Ohio,
or any other Indian reservation, to which the title has been, or
may be extinguished at any time during the operation of the
Pre-emption Acts, by the United States; <i>fourth</i>, sections of
lands reserved to the United States, alternate to other sections
granted to any State for the construction of any canal, railroad,
or other public improvement; <i>fifth</i>, sections, or fractions of
sections, included within the limits of any incorporated town;
<i>sixth</i>, every portion of the public lands which has been selected
as a site for a city or town; <i>seventh</i>, every parcel or lot of land
actually settled and occupied for the purposes of trade and
agriculture; and, <i>eighth</i>, all lands in which are situated any
known salines or mines.</p>

<p>Persons claiming the benefit of the Pre-emption Acts are
required to file duplicate affidavits, such as are specified by law,
and to furnish proof, by one or more disinterested witnesses,
of the facts necessary to establish the requisites mentioned in
the first paragraph of this article; such witnesses having first
been duly sworn or affirmed by some competent authority.</p>

<p>If adverse claims are made to the same tract, each claimant
is to be notified of the time and place of taking testimony, and
allowed to cross-examine the opposite witnesses, and to furnish
counter-proof, itself subject to cross-examination. If, by reason
of distance, sickness, or infirmity, the witnesses cannot personally
appear before the register of the land office, their depositions,
taken in conformity with the following regulations, may
be received:</p>

<p>The notice to adverse claimants must be in writing, and
served in time to allow at least one day for every twenty miles
which the party may have to travel in going to the place of
taking evidence. The proof, in all cases, should consist of a
simple detail of facts merely, and not of broad and general
statements. If the pre-emptor be “the head of a family,” the
witnesses must state the facts constituting him such; whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
he be a husband having a wife and children, or a widower, or
an unmarried person under twenty-one years of age, having a
family, either of relatives or others, dependent upon him, or
hired persons. All the facts relative to the settlement in person,
inhabitancy, or personal residence, the time of its commencement,
the manner and extent of its continuance, as also
those sharing the apparent objects, must be stated. It must
be stated that the claimant made the settlement on the land in
person; that he has erected a dwelling upon the land; that he
lived in the same, and made it his home, etc. In the event of
a decision by the land officer against the claimant, he may
appeal to the Commissioner of the Land Office at Washington.</p>

<p>No entry will be permitted until the affidavit required of the
claimant is taken. Duplicates thereof must be signed by the
claimant, and the fact of the oath being taken must be certified
by the register or receiver administering the same; one copy to
be filed in the Register’s office, and the other to be sent to the
Land Office at Washington.</p>

<p>A purchaser of public land is only required to make written
application to the Register of the local land office for the tract
desired to be entered, and to pay to the Receiver the purchase
money therefor. Blank forms of such application are furnished
gratuitously at the Land Office where the tract is desired to be
entered.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Soldiers’ Homestead Law of 1872.</span></h5>

<p>The following is the full text of the Amendatory Soldiers’
Homestead Bill, approved by the President on the 3d of April,
1872.</p>

<p><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>:
That every private soldier and officer who has served in the
army of the United States during the recent rebellion for ninety
days or more, and who was honorably discharged, and has
remained loyal to the government, including the troops mustered
into the service of the United States by virtue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
third section of an act entitled “An act making appropriations
for completing the defenses of Washington, and for other purposes,”
approved February 13th, 1862, and every seaman,
marine, and officer who has served in the navy of the United
States, or in the marine corps, during the rebellion, for ninety
days, and who was honorably discharged, and has remained
loyal to the government, shall, on compliance with the provisions
of an act entitled “An act to secure homesteads to
actual settlers on the public domain,” and the acts amendatory
thereof, as hereinafter modified, be entitled to enter upon and
receive patents for a quantity of public lands (not mineral) not
exceeding one hundred and sixty acres, or one quarter-section,
to be taken in compact form according to legal subdivision,
including the alternate reserved section of public lands along
the line of any railroad or other public work not otherwise
reserved or appropriated, and other lands subject to entry under
the homestead laws of the United States: <i>Provided</i>, the said
homestead settler shall be allowed six months after locating
his homestead within which to commence his settlement and
improvements: <i>And provided also</i>, the time which the homestead
settler shall have served in the army, navy, or marine
corps aforesaid shall be deducted from the time heretofore
required to perfect title, or if discharged on account of wounds
received, or disability incurred in the line of duty, then the
term of enlistment shall be deducted from the time heretofore
required to perfect title, without reference to the length of
time he may have served: <i>Provided, however</i>, that no patent
shall issue to any homestead settler who has not resided upon,
improved and cultivated his said homestead for a period of at
least one year after he shall commence his improvements as
aforesaid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> That any person entitled under the provisions
of the foregoing section to enter a homestead, who may have
heretofore entered under the Homestead law a quantity of land
less than one hundred and sixty acres, shall be permitted to
enter under the provisions of this act so much land as, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
added to the quantity previously entered, shall not exceed one
hundred and sixty acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 3.</span> That in the case of the death of any person who
would be entitled to a homestead under the provisions of the
first section of this act, his widow, if unmarried, or in case of
her death or marriage, then his minor orphan children, by a
guardian duly approved and officially accredited at the Department
of the Interior, shall be entitled to all the benefits enumerated
in this act, subject to all the provisions as to settlement
and improvements therein contained: <i>Provided</i>, that if
such person died during his term of enlistment, the whole term
of his enlistment shall be deducted from the time heretofore
required to perfect the title.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 4.</span> That where a party, at the date of his entry of a
tract of land under the Homestead laws, or subsequently thereto,
was actually enlisted and employed in the army or navy of the
United States, his services therein shall, in the administration
of said Homestead laws, be construed to be equivalent, to all
intents and purposes, to a residence for the same length of time
upon the tract so entered: <i>Provided</i>, that if his entry has
been canceled by reason of his absence from said tract while in
the military or naval service of the United States, and such tract
has not been disposed of, his entry shall be restored and confirmed:
<i>And provided further</i>, that if such tract has been
disposed of, said party may enter another tract subject to the
entry under said laws, and his right to a patent therefor shall
be determined by the proofs touching his residence and cultivation
of the first tract and his absence therefrom in such
service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 5.</span> That any soldier, sailor, marine, officer, or other
person coming within the provisions of this act may, as well
<span class="smcap">by an agent</span> as in person, enter upon said homestead: <i>Provided</i>,
that the said claimant in person shall, within the time
prescribed [<span class="smcap">six months from date of entry</span>] commence settlement
and improvement on the same, and thereafter fulfill all
the requirements of this act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 6.</span> That the commissioner of the General Land
Office shall have authority to make all needful rules and regulations
to carry into effect the provisions of this act.”</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">PATENTS.</span></h4>

<p>1. These originated in the desire of the founders of the
government to encourage invention, in the belief that the general
welfare of the country would be promoted by such a stimulus
to genius, and the power to grant patents was expressly
bestowed on Congress. That this was a very wise forethought
there is no doubt. The hope of reward has given
birth to innumerable inventions, among which some have been
of incalculable value to the country, increasing its wealth
almost beyond our power to estimate. It is, however, worth
considering if there may not be a limit to the usefulness of the
system, in its present form, in the changed conditions of the
country. It is often the case that what accomplished the
greatest good in its proper day, is at length outgrown, and
becomes an embarrassment, requiring to be either essentially
modified or laid aside.</p>

<p>2. A patent right is an exclusive right, granted by an officer
denominated the Commissioner of Patents, in conformity to
law, to the inventor or discoverer of any new and useful article.
The exclusive right is conferred by acts of Congress, on compliance
of the inventor with certain conditions which are
clearly specified in the law. The evidence that such exclusive
right has been conferred on any individual, is contained in a
document, called “letters patent,” issued at the patent office
in Washington; signed by the Secretary of the Interior, (formerly
by the Secretary of State), countersigned by the Commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of Patents, and sealed with the seal of his office.
Thus protected, he alone can make, use and sell the article he
has invented, for the term of fourteen years; and upon showing
a good reason therefor, the commissioner will extend the
term seven years longer, or Congress will pass a special act for
that purpose.</p>

<p>3. This was the law up to 1861; and is still in force as to
patents granted anterior to that date. But a new act was then
passed, extending the term of an original patent to seventeen,
instead of fourteen years, and prohibiting any extension of
such patents.</p>

<p>An inventor, before he can obtain a patent, must swear that
he believes he is the inventor or discoverer of the art, machine,
or improvement, for which he solicits a patent. He must also
give in writing a clear, minute description of it; and, when
necessary, must make and deliver a model of his invention;
which in all cases must be something new, unused and unknown
before, or his application will be rejected. There is considerable
expense attending the procurement of a patent right.</p>

<p>4. But when obtained, no person except the patentee, has
any right to make, sell, or use the article patented, until the
time has expired for which this exclusive right was granted,
without the permission of the patentee. Any person doing so
is liable to a heavy penalty, and may be prosecuted in the Circuit
Court of the United States; this court having original
jurisdiction in all cases arising under the patent laws. But a
writ of error or an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of the
United States.</p>

<p>5. The Patent Office, when first established, was a bureau
of the State Department, and the Commissioner of Patents
acted under the direction of the Secretary of State. But after
the creation of the Department of the Interior, in 1849, it was
transferred to it, became a bureau of the new department, and
the commissioner now acts under the general direction of its
secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<h5>THE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS</h5>

<p>6. Is appointed by the President and Senate. His duties
are best explained in the language of the law itself, which, in
speaking of the creation and appointment of this official, says
that his duties shall be “to superintend, execute and perform
all such acts and things touching and respecting the granting
and issuing of patents for new and useful discoveries, inventions
and improvements, as are herein provided for, or shall
hereafter be by law directed to be done and performed.”</p>

<p>He has the charge and custody of all books, records, papers,
models, machines, and all other things belonging to the patent
office; and has the privilege of sending and receiving letters
and packages by mail, relating to the business of the office, free
of postage. He has the power to appoint his clerks, examiners
and subordinates; among whom are patent office agents,
who may be appointed in not more than twenty of the principal
cities and towns in the United States. It is their duty to
forward to the patent office all such models, specimens and
manufactures, as shall be intended to be patented.</p>

<p>7. In cases of appeal from the decision of the commissioner,
the appeal may be made to the board of examiners, or
to the Chief Justice of the District Court of the United States
for the District of Columbia. There is a seal for the patent
office, which the commissioner keeps, and which he must affix
to patents when granted, and to other papers and records issued
from his office, which are wanted as evidence in other places.</p>

<p>He is also authorized to publish a classified and alphabetical
list of all patents issued at the patent office. This he frequently
does, for the information of the public.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">PENSIONS.</span></h4>

<p>Pensions are a provision, made by the general government,
for the officers and privates of the army and navy disabled in
the service of the country. They peril their lives for the protection
of the public, and it has always been regarded as just
that a support, proportioned to the extent of injury received,
should be given to them, or to those dependent on them in
case of their death. It is properly a continuance of pay in
consideration of the services rendered. It does not often
amount to a full support, and is graduated by the amount each
received, according to rank.</p>

<h5>A COMMISSIONER OF PENSIONS</h5>

<p class="noindent">Was appointed and placed at the head of a bureau, at first in
the War Department, but afterward transferred to the care of
the Secretary of the Interior. It is a Pension Office, in fact.
This commissioner is appointed by the President and Senate
in the same manner as other important officers. It is his duty
to carry into effect the pension laws. He is authorized to
appoint pension agents in all the States and Territories, who
receive and distribute the money due to pensioners in their
several districts, the agents receiving from the government a
percentage for their services.</p>

<p>There has always been a large number on the list. At first
they were the disabled soldiers and sailors of the Revolutionary
War; then of the War of 1812 with England, followed in
1846 by the Mexican War. But all these were few compared
with the number disabled in the Civil War. The amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
appropriated by Congress for the year 1873-4, for pensions was
$30,480,000. The law carefully protects the pensions against
frauds and forbids its attachment by any legal process whatever.
The nation is grateful to its brave defenders.</p>

<p>The proper officials to whom all applications should be made,
by letter or petition, in Washington, are, by a soldier having
his discharge, to the Paymaster General; when the discharge
paper is lost, to the Second Auditor of the Treasury; when by
those who represent a deceased person, to the second Auditor of
the Treasury; when for commutation of rations, to the same
officer; when for pensions, or any matter connected with pensions,
to the Commissioner of Pensions.</p>

<p>Instructions have been prepared for all applicants, by the
Commissioner of Pensions for the purpose of preventing
fraud or misunderstanding. They are, in substance:</p>

<h5>INSTRUCTIONS.</h5>

<p>By the act of Congress approved July 14th, 1862, and amendatory
acts, pensions are granted as follows:</p>

<p>1. Invalids, disabled in the military or naval service of the
United States, in the line of duty.</p>

<p>2. Widows of persons who have been killed or have died in
the military or naval service of the United States.</p>

<p>3. Children under sixteen, of the classes of persons on
account of whose death widows are entitled; provided said
widows have died, or have remarried.</p>

<p>4. Mothers of all classes of persons on account of whose
death widows are entitled, provided said mothers were dependent
on the deceased for support and no minor child survived.</p>

<p>5. Fathers, the same as mothers, in case of the death of
the latter.</p>

<p>6. Brothers and sisters, under sixteen, provided they were
dependent for support upon the person on account of whose
decease they claim.</p>

<p>The First Section of the Act of July 14th, 1862, showing
the rates of pension to the several classes and grades, is as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America, in Congress assembled</i>, That
if any officer, non-commissioned officer, musician, or private
of the army, including regulars, volunteers, militia, or any
officer, warrant, or petty officer, musician, seaman, ordinary

<h5><span class="smcap">Act of July 4, 1864.</span></h5>

<p>Various supplementary Acts have been passed by the Act
of July 14, 1862, modifying in some particulars the provisions
of previous legislation.</p>

<p>By the Act of July 4, 1864, it is provided that biennial
examinations will hereafter be made by one surgeon only, if he
is regularly appointed, or holds a surgeon’s commission in the
army. Examinations by unappointed civil surgeons will not
be accepted, unless it can be shown that an examination by a
commissioned or duly appointed surgeon is impracticable.</p>

<p><i>Increased Pensions in Certain Cases.</i>—A pension of
twenty-five dollars per month is granted to those having lost
both hands or both eyes in the military service of the United
States, in the line of duty, and twenty dollars per month to
those who, under the same conditions, shall have lost both feet,
if such parties were entitled to a lower rate of pension under
the act of 1862. This higher pension will date only from the
4th day of July, 1864, in case of pensioners already enrolled,
or of applicants discharged prior to that date.</p>

<p><i>Evidence of Muster-in.</i>—In accordance with the 11th Section
of the Act of July 4, 1864, evidence of the muster-in of
the soldier will not be required in any case, but there must be
positive record evidence of service. Evidence of muster-in in
the case of commissioned officers is still required.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Act of June 6, 1866.</span></h5>

<p>The Supplementary Pension Act, approved June six, eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
hundred and sixty-six, provides increased rates of pensions
over those granted by the Act of July fourteen, eighteen hundred
and sixty-two, in the following cases, viz.:</p>

<p>1. Twenty-five dollars per month to all those invalids entitled,
under the Act of July fourteen, eighteen hundred and
sixty-two, to a lower rate of pension, on account of service
rendered since March four, eighteen hundred and sixty-one,
“who shall have lost the sight of both eyes, or who shall have
lost both hands, or been permanently and totally disabled in
the same, or otherwise so permanently and totally disabled as
to render them utterly helpless, or so nearly so as to require
the constant personal aid and attendance of another person.”</p>

<p>2. Twenty dollars per month to those invalids who, being
entitled under like conditions to a lower rate of pension, “shall
have lost both feet, or one hand and one foot, or been totally
and permanently disabled in the same, or otherwise so disabled
as to be incapacitated for performing any manual labor, but not
so much so as to require constant personal aid and attention.”</p>

<p>3. Fifteen dollars per month to those invalids who, under
like conditions, “shall have lost one hand or one foot, or been
totally and permanently disabled in the same, or otherwise so
disabled as to render their inability to perform manual labor
equivalent to the loss of a hand or a foot.”</p>

<p>In order to obtain the benefits of the foregoing provisions,
pensioners already enrolled will file an application in accordance
with form F, appended hereto. Proof in addition to
that on file with the previous application need not be forwarded,
except as shall be specially required in each case, after the
application is received. The applicant need only be examined
by a pension surgeon when expressly required, on due notice
from this office. Applicants not already pensioned, who believe
themselves entitled to the benefit of the foregoing provisions,
will specifically set forth such claim in their declarations, carefully
stating the nature of the disability on account of which
such higher rate of pension is claimed. The declaration must
be made before some officer of a court of record, or before a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
pension notary designated by this office, as provided by the
third section of the act of July four, eighteen hundred and
sixty-four.</p>

<p>The above specified increased rates of pension will be allowed
only to those disabled since the fourth day of March, eighteen
hundred and sixty-one, and will date only from the sixth day
of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.</p>

<p><i>Teamsters, Artificers, and other Enlisted Men</i>,—not embraced
in the terms of the Act of July fourteen, eighteen
hundred and sixty-two, or of Acts supplementary thereto, are,
by the tenth section of the Act of June six, eighteen hundred
and sixty-six, included in the administration of the pension
laws, in the class of non-commissioned officers and privates.</p>

<p><i>Minor Children to be Pensioned, in Certain Cases, instead
of the Widow.</i>—The eleventh section provides that when any
widow, entitled to a pension under previous Acts, has abandoned
the care of a child or children of her deceased husband,
under sixteen years of age, “or is an unsuitable person, by
reason of immoral conduct, to have the custody of the same,”
the pension shall be paid to the duly authorized guardian of
such child or children, while under the age of sixteen years,
and not to the widow. The proper proof in such case, as provided
by this section, is the certificate of the judge of any
court having probate jurisdiction, “that satisfactory evidence
has been produced before such court” to the effect above indicated.
In presenting an application under this section, the
guardians of the minor child or children will make a declaration
in accordance with the appended form G.</p>

<p><i>Pensions Granted to Dependent Fathers and to Dependent
Orphan Brothers.</i>—By the twelfth section the provisions of
the Act of July fourteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, are
extended so as to include the dependent brother or brothers of
a deceased officer, soldier or seaman, and the dependent father
of such deceased persons, under like limitations as apply in
the case of dependent sisters and mothers; but not more than
one pension is granted on account of the same person, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
more than one of said classes. The forms prescribed for the
latter cases may be used, with obvious variations, in applications
made by dependent fathers or on behalf of dependent
brothers.</p>

<p><i>Limitations as to Number and Date of Pensions.</i>—The
thirteenth section declares that but one pension shall be granted
to any person at the same time; and that when application is
not made within three years after the death or discharge of the
party on whose account a pension is claimed, such pension, if
allowed, “shall commence from the date of filing the last
paper in said case by the party prosecuting the same.” This
limitation applies to all classes of pensions.</p>

<p><i>Evidence of Marriage of Colored Applicants.</i>—The fourteenth
section provides that habitual recognition of the marriage
relation between colored parties—that is, in the absence of the
usually required proof—when shown by “proof satisfactory to
the Commissioner of Pensions,” shall be accepted as evidence
of marriage, and the children of such parties shall be regarded
as if born in lawful wedlock. When the usual proof of marriage
can be furnished, it will be required as heretofore. When
only evidence of cohabitation and mutual recognition can be
adduced, as provided in this section, the testimony of two credible
and disinterested witnesses will be required, who must
state how long they have been personally acquainted with the
parties, and for how long a period the latter are known to have
recognized each other as man and wife. If such acquaintance
is deemed to be of too recent date to warrant the acceptance
of this testimony, or if there is reason to doubt, in any instance,
that the marriage relation existed in good faith, more specific
instructions will be issued, adapted to the circumstances of the
particular case.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Act of July 25, 1866.</span></h5>

<p><i>Provost Marshals, Enrolling Officers, and others Entitled
to the Benefits of the Pension Laws.</i>—The first section of the
Act of July twenty-five, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, extends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the benefits conferred by the pension laws to provost marshals,
deputy provost marshals, and enrolling officers disabled in the
line of their official duty as such, and to the widows or dependents
of such officers in like manner.</p>

<p>Declarations will be made in accordance with the instructions
issued under the Pension Act of July fourteen, eighteen hundred
and sixty-two, and supplementary Acts. The grade of
such officers, for the purpose of determining the rates of pensions
under this section, is fixed as follows: Provost marshals
will rank as captains; their deputies as first lieutenants; and
enrolling officers as second lieutenants.</p>

<p><i>Increased Pensions to Widows, and Orphan Children
Under Sixteen Years of Age.</i>—The second section of this act
allows to those who are or shall be pensioned as widows of soldiers
or sailors, two dollars per month additional pension for
each child (under sixteen years of age) of the deceased soldier
or sailor by the widow thus pensioned.</p>

<p>On the death or remarriage of such widow, or on the denial
of a pension to her, in accordance with the provisions of section
eleven of the Act of June six, eighteen hundred and sixty-six,
the same amount to which she would otherwise be entitled,
under this and previous provisions, is allowed to the minor
children. The number and names of the children, with their
ages, must be proved by the affidavits of two credible and disinterested
witnesses. The provisions of this section only
include the children of the widow, and not those of her
deceased husband by a previous marriage. The widows of
minor children of officers are not entitled to this increase.
Declarations for an increase under this section, if for the
widow, will be made in accordance with form H, appended
hereto; and if for minor children, according to form I. The
pension certificate must be sent with all applications filed
subsequently to September four, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.</p>

<p><i>Increase of Pensions under Acts prior to July 4, 1862.</i>—All
pensioners under Acts approved prior to July fourteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
eighteen hundred and sixty-two, are, by the third section of the
present act, granted the same rights as those pensioned under
acts approved at or since that date, so far as said Acts may be
applicable, with the exception of soldiers of the Revolution or
their widows. This section applies only to pensioners who
were such at the date of the approval of this Act.</p>

<p>Declaration of claimants under this section will be made in
accordance with the forms previously issued under Act of July
fourteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and subsequent pension
acts, with the necessary modifications, and the pension
certificates will be returned.</p>

<p><i>Invalid Pensions of Claimants Dying while their Applications
are Pending, the Evidence being Completed.</i>—The
fourth section of this act is construed in connection with the
tenth section of the Act of July four, eighteen hundred and
sixty-four, and the sixth section of the Act of June six, eighteen
hundred and sixty-six, to which it is supplementary. If
an applicant for invalid pension dies while his claim is pending,
the evidence having been completed, the pension, under
the provisions of this section and of those sections of previous
acts above referred to, is disposed of as follows:</p>

<p>1. If he left a widow, or minor child, or children under
sixteen years of age, or other dependent relatives, and died of
wounds received or of disease contracted in the service or in
the line of duty, no invalid pension certificate will issue, but
such widow or dependent relatives will receive a pension, in
their own right, taking precedence in the order prescribed by
law in other cases.</p>

<p>2. If the claimant left a widow or dependent relatives, but
did not die of wounds received, or disease contracted in the
service and in the line of duty, so that neither widow nor
dependent relatives would be entitled to a pension on his
account, then the certificate will be issued in his name, and the
pension paid to the widow or to the dependent relatives, as the
case may be, in the same order in which they would have been
pensioned, if entitled, as set forth in the preceding paragraph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>3. If the claimant left no widow or dependent relatives, the
certificate will issue in his name, and the pension will be drawn
by his executor or administrator.</p>

<p><i>Certain Accrued Rights Reserved under Repealed Enactments.</i>—The
fifth section reserves all rights that may have
accrued under the fifth section of the pension Act of July four,
eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and the third section of the
pension Act of March three, eighteen hundred and sixty-five,
though repealed by the first section of the Act of June six,
eighteen hundred sixty-six.</p>

<p><i>Widows Remarrying while their Claims are Pending</i>,—Are
entitled, under the sixth section, if their claims are otherwise
valid, to receive pensions to the date of remarriage, if the
deceased officer, soldier or sailor, on whose account they claim,
left no legitimate child under sixteen years of age.</p>

the failure of any pensioner to claim his or her pension for

satisfactorily accounting for such failure, the pensioner
may be restored to the rolls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sect. 4.</span>—<i>Increase of Pensions of Widows and of Children
by a former Wife.</i>—This section gives an increase of
two dollars per month for each minor child of a deceased soldier,
to commence from the death of their father, and continue
until they severally attain the age of sixteen years; and provides
that the children of a former marriage shall be “entitled

thereto, shall commence from the discharge or death of the
person on whose account the pension has been or shall be

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">INDIAN AFFAIRS.</span></h4>

<p>When America was discovered, in 1492, the whole continent
was thinly populated (except in some few regions where a
considerable degree of civilization and skill in agriculture had
been attained, as in Mexico and Peru) by roving tribes of
natives, of unknown origin. These were called, by Europeans,
Indians, from the erroneous idea of Columbus, and the men
of that age at first, that there was only one continent; and
that they had reached the eastern shore of Asia, when America
was discovered.</p>

<p>The whole of the region comprising our country was in the
possession of a great number of these tribes. Their number,
when permanent settlements began to be made, is not known,
but probably amounted, in all the vast territory, to only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
few million—perhaps two or three. They divided the country
between them, in an indefinite way, war and hunting being
their chief occupations. They attempted very little cultivation
of the soil. The settlements of the Indians were as indefinite
and moveable as their boundaries, and they attached little value
to land. Territory was acquired from them partly by force
and partly by purchase. These last were usually made for a
nominal sum, and with little comprehension, on their part, of
the importance and future effects of its alienation.</p>

<p>As the settlements of Europeans extended, frequent and barbarous
wars, greatly exasperating the whites, arose as a revenge
for private injuries, or in retaliation of encroachments on their
hunting grounds. As these always ended, ultimately, in favor
of the settlers, and the Indians were driven farther back, the
country was taken possession of as the spoils of conquest.
These desolating contests, and the easily-acquired vices of the
whites constantly diminished their numbers. They were so
inherently wild men that the conquered remnants usually
withered and faded away under the process of civilization.</p>

<p>When, after the War of the Revolution, the settlements came
to be consolidated and extensive, under the rapid growth of
the population, lands were reserved for these remnants; treaties
were made with them, as with independent nations; and, from
their improvidence and carelessness as to the economical preservation
of their resources, the indemnities allowed them for
the lands to which they renounced all claim were paid to them
in installments, or as annuities, by the government. This system
has been continued to the present day, and has occasioned
the establishment of the</p>

<h5>INDIAN BUREAU OF THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.</h5>

<p>It is presided over by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
appointed in the usual way by the President and Senate.
Numerous Superintendents and agents are appointed to reside
near the different locations assigned to the Indians, to conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the business under his supervision, and receive and distribute
the goods and moneys given by treaty to each tribe. They give
bonds for faithfulness in the employment of funds destined
for the Indians. They are appointed for four years, and report
and account to the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>Except a few who are taxed, the Indians are not counted
among our population as citizens. They have, therefore, no
representative in Congress, nor, except the criminal law to
some extent, are they amenable to other of our laws than such
as the treaties have established. Their internal government is
conducted by themselves alone, neither governor, judge, nor
courts being established, as in other Territorial jurisdictions.</p>

<p>They are difficult to control, however, not recognizing, as
civilized people do (except a small number who are far on the
way to civilization), the obligations of treaties and pledges.
Dishonest and self-seeking men often take advantage of their
ignorance and their love of ardent spirits and trinkets, to cheat
and injure them. To remedy this as far as possible, white
men are not permitted to reside on their reservations unless by
special license of the government. Nor can they alienate their
lands to white men not officials acting under government
supervision.</p>

<p>All pains are required to be taken by the government officers
to promote their interests, and schools and missions are encouraged
among them, and agricultural implements are furnished
so far as they can be persuaded to use them. In short, it is
the benevolent and enlightened aim of the government to act
as the guardians of their true interests, to encourage mental
and moral culture among them, and assist them toward the
acquisition of the arts and comforts of civilized life.</p>

<p>It will easily be comprehended that many difficulties oppose
themselves to this effort with a race whose instincts are so wild
and fierce, and who adopt our vices so much more readily than
our virtues, and are so easily influenced by bad and designing
men. Still, progress is made, as will be seen in the case of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<h5>THE INDIAN TERRITORY.</h5>

<p>It is situated south of the 37th degree of north latitude, and
west of the States of Arkansas and Missouri. Texas bounds
it on the south. It has 71,127 square miles, and is about a
third larger than the State of Illinois. It is very fertile, for
the most part, and a beautiful region. It is inhabited, in great
part, by Indians who have been transferred from the regions
east of the Mississippi, mostly Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws,
and Seminoles. Some of these were removed by persuasion,
and some by force, from their former homes, where they were
disturbed by proximity to the rapidly increasing white
population.</p>

<p>Each tribe has its own section of the Territory. Here they
practice their own customs unmolested, and conduct their own
government. Many of them, especially the Cherokees, are
intelligent and industrious. They have churches and schools
and factories, highly-cultivated farms and good buildings.
Improvement is so marked among them that it is not improbable
that they may at some future time become a State in our
Union. At present they are amenable to the Circuit and
District Courts of the adjoining States when certain crimes are
committed by them against the whites in those States, but
our courts have no authority over their relations to one another.</p>

<p>The population of the Territory is 70,000. The entire
Indian population of the country is over 300,000. They are
scattered over the States and Territories between the Missouri
river and the Pacific coast, and those outside the Indian Territory
are often at war with each other and with our citizens,
requiring many troops and a large expense to keep them in
subjection. It is probable that, as a race, they will soon become
extinct, except, perhaps, those in the Indian Territory. They
are uneasy, and dangerous neighbors to the whites in those
sparsely-settled regions. The amount appropriated to the
Indians by Congress for the year 1873-4, was $5,513,937, which
was exclusive of their annuities, or funds invested for them,
of which they receive the annual interest.</p>

<span class="smaller">CENSUS BUREAU.</span></h4>

<p>1. A census is an enumeration, or counting, of the inhabitants
of any country. History informs us that this was done
in very ancient times. One of the books in the Old Testament
(Numbers) was named from the circumstance that it
contains an account of the numbering of the Israelites, by
the order of Moses. That numbering was a <i>census</i> of the people
composing the Jewish nation. It not only gives us the
total number of the people, but that of each tribe; much after
our own mode of doing the same thing. We take ours by
States, and we find the total of the whole nation. In ancient
times a census seems to have been taken more for military
than for any other purpose. This is one of the objects in the
present day; but in modern times many uses are made of a
census. It not only shows the military power of a nation, but
when taken with the distinction of sex, and age, with an
account of the births, marriages, and deaths during each year,
it throws much light upon a variety of interesting topics; such
as the longevity, the rate of mortality, the ratio of increase,
and the average duration of human life. These, and many
other important facts are obtained by a census.</p>

<p>2. In the United States the census is the only means by
which Congress determines the number of Representatives
each State is entitled to have in that body. Hence the Constitution
itself makes provision for the enumeration of the
people once in ten years—called a decade. The first was made
in 1790, the next in 1800, and so on every tenth year. If the
number of any year ends with a cipher, we know that the
United States census was taken, or will be taken, in that year,
whether we look backward or forward.</p>

<p>3. Up to the present time, according to the provisions made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
in the Constitution, a census has been taken nine times, and
under the head of recapitulation (see index) we find what it
was each time. We also find that from the first (1790), to the
last (1870), the population had increased from 3,929,827, to
38,838,180. Therefore it approximates very nearly to 40,000,000;
indicating a growth unparalleled by any nation in ancient
or modern times.</p>

<p>We will next state how this great national work is performed.
The Constitution simply declares that it shall be done, but the
laws specify <i>how</i> it shall be done, and <i>who</i> shall do it.</p>

<p>The United States Marshals are the officers designated by the
law as the persons who shall make the enumeration of the people
in each State and Territory; in addition to which they are
also required to procure other statistical matter, as directed by
Congress.</p>

<p>4. In order to accomplish this work, it is necessary to
employ a number of assistant marshals, one of whom must
visit every house in his district, and ascertain the number of
persons belonging to it, together with such statistical information
as is required. This is all returned to the Marshal, and
by him sent to the Department of the Interior at Washington,
where, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, it
is made into a report, and then laid before Congress, to be used
by it in apportioning to the States their quota of Representatives.
This apportionment is actually made in the Department
of the Interior, and then laid before Congress for its examination
and approval. The Marshal appoints and commissions
his deputies, who must be sworn to perform the duties assigned
to them, to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>5. In the department of the Interior there is a board whose
duty it is to superintend the work of taking the census. It
prepares, prints, and sends to every Marshal the blanks to be
used by him and his assistants; and when they have made
returns of their work, the board arranges them preparatory to
laying them before Congress. After this they are published,
and make a valuable work of reference; for they contain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
vast amount of statistical information—such as the number
of acres of land under cultivation, the number of bushels of
grain of every kind produced in the year; the number of
horses, cattle, sheep, swine, &amp;c., raised; the number of manufacturing
establishments, and the amount of their productions;
the number of churches, schools, colleges, &amp;c.; the number of
deaf, blind, idiotic, and insane persons; together with much
other matter, quite too voluminous for insertion here.</p>

<p>6. All this is done by order of Congress, and of course
paid for from the United States Treasury.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this book (see index) we give a tabular statement
of the population of each State and Territory, at each
time the census has been taken by the United States. It shows
the increase at each decade from 1790, the first time it was
taken, to 1870—the last at this date. This table also shows
the increase in the number of States, from the original 13 to
the present 37, besides the Territories, which alone are larger
than the original 13 States, and nearly as numerous.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.</span></h4>

<p>Was established by an act of Congress, May, 1862. It is
not, like the other Departments of the Executive Branch of
the government, superintended by a Secretary with a seat in
the President’s Cabinet. Its Head is called The Commissioner
of Agriculture, and he is appointed by the President, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, like other civil officers.
The creation of this office is a recognition of the extreme
importance of this industry to the prosperity and welfare of
the nation. Our country is eminently an agricultural one; and
the interests confided to this department are those of a class
of the people more numerous than any other, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
success of whose labors depends the well being of all. In
proportion as this industry attains a high state of development,
and is generally prosperous, do the professional, mercantile,
and manufacturing classes increase in wealth. It is the foundation
on which they build.</p>

<p>The great fertility of our country, and the breadth of area
adapted to all the most useful products of the world, and the
need of instruction, suggestion, and aid in properly adapting
agricultural products to the soil and climate, by the large
number of settlers in regions with whose peculiarities they are
but partially familiar, give a special interest and value to this
new Department.</p>

<p>Its duty is to watch over this large field and make such
suggestions to Congress in regard to legislation as shall seem
called for; to disseminate such practical information among
the people as it may be able to acquire by intelligent observation
in this and other countries; and the testing and dissemination
of rare and untried plants of other countries that promise
to increase our agricultural resources.</p>

<p>For experiments in the latter case, a propagating garden
and grounds are provided, and the most skillful and intelligent
officers, bringing all the lights of science to their assistance,
devote themselves to the study of these plants, as to the soil
and climate best adapted to them, the proper modes of cultivation,
and to acclimating them to our country. This branch
of the department sends, to suitable sections of the country,
such plants and seeds as it has reason to believe it will be
profitable to introduce and cultivate. This usage, continued
for many years, will, no doubt, contribute very greatly to the
variety of useful products which add to our comfort and
wealth.</p>

<p>The department keeps skillful chemists and naturalists constantly
employed to gather information of various kinds, that
may be useful to agriculturists. The character of soils, the
influences of climate, the best system of farming, the diseases
of domestic animals, and plants and their cure, the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
mode of preserving crops from the ravages of insects, and
many others are the subjects of careful investigation, and the
information thus gained is freely communicated to the country
at large.</p>

<p>There is a statistical division, in which facts are gathered
from the whole country and published monthly. This serves
many useful purposes. It also collects data, for purposes of
comparison and instruction, from foreign countries. Whatever
facts it may be most useful for farmers to know, whatever crops
it may be most profitable for them to produce, and whatever
improvements in the modes of agriculture and in agricultural
implements are discovered to be possible are communicated
to all without cost.</p>

<p>Agricultural education receives much attention from the
department, and all the facts and influences that can aid in
making farmers thoroughly intelligent in their own pursuit,
are gathered and employed with effect. Agriculture cannot
but improve immeasureably under this fostering care, and this
Department is likely to become one of the most important and
useful in the government. It is yet in its infancy, but has
already accomplished much good.</p>

<p>The commissioner reports annually to Congress. He has
power to appoint such officers as Congress considers necessary.
In 1868 a fine building for this department was completed at a
cost of $140,000. It contains a chemical laboratory with all
the necessary apparatus and materials, and a museum, or collection
of specimens, of value in the study of agriculture,
store-rooms for seeds to be sent throughout the country, &amp;c.
The beauty of the building and grounds adds a very attractive
feature to the National Capital, and the Institution itself is a
favorable comment on the wise and provident care bestowed
by the government on the leading interest of the people.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT AND POST MASTER
GENERAL.</span></h4>

<p>This department of the government, whose head, the Post
Master General, is a member of the Cabinet, exists by virtue
of Section 8, Article 1st of the Constitution, where are these
words: “Congress shall have the power to establish post
offices and post roads.”</p>

<p>From small beginnings, in early colonial times, and continued
through the Revolutionary War, it has grown to be one
of the largest and most important departments of the government.
The security, speed, and cheapness of intercourse
between all parts of the country and with foreign lands, is of
the utmost importance to business and commerce; it encourages
social intercourse and intimate relations among the people, and
is of no small consequence in developing their intelligence and
promoting their improvement.</p>

<p>By successive laws of Congress it has been perfected to its
present state of excellence. The duties connected with it are
performed by many thousands of persons in every part of the
country. They are of average intelligence and education, and
must be trained to their work almost without personal instruction
or supervision, yet so complete is the organization, and so
pervading the influence of the central power, the regulations
so simple, clear, and precise, that mistakes are extremely rare,
considering the great number of transactions, and instances
of misconduct in office are probably less frequent than in any
other branch of the public service, though employing persons
well trained and under close surveillance.</p>

<p>The Post Master General is appointed by the President and
the Senate for four years. His office is in the General Post
Office at Washington. He has three assistants, appointed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the same manner as himself. He has a seal of his office, an
impression from which must be affixed to the commission of
every postmaster in the United States; and also to all copies
of papers and documents that may be wanted from his office.
This only can give them official value of the same importance
as the original papers. He must give bonds as security for
faithfulness in office, and take the usual official oath.</p>

<p>He has the entire direction and management of the Department,
and the appointment of all local postmasters (in law
considered as his deputies), whose salary is less than $1,000
per annum. All others are appointed by the President and
Senate.</p>

<p>That its business may be more conveniently arranged and
prepared for his final action, it is distributed among several
bureaus, or minor departments as follows:</p>

<h5>THE APPOINTMENT OFFICE.</h5>

<p>Includes the divisions of appointments; bonds given by
postmasters, agents, and clerks; salaries and allowances, where
they are not provided for by law; free delivery in cities; and
the agency of blanks used in the extensive business and reports
of the department. This office is in charge of the First
Assistant Post Master General.</p>

<h5>THE CONTRACT OFFICE.</h5>

<p>This includes the divisions of contracts for carrying the
mails, by persons or companies; the inspection of the entire
process of carrying the mails, to secure their safe, regular, and
prompt delivery; mail equipment, or the supply of all the
material and conveniences for transportation of the mail, furnished
by the department; special agents, and mail depredations,
which has the care of all violations of law and the conduct
and accounts of all agents employed for the suppression
and prevention of abuses; and the Topographical, which has
charge of maps and diagrams of mail routes, and geographical
information, required for the various branches of the service.
It is in charge of the Second Assistant Post Master General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<h5>THE FINANCE OFFICE.</h5>

<p>This is separated into the divisions of Finance, which has
charge of the entire cash receipts, transfers, and disbursements
of the department; of postage stamps and stamped envelopes,
newspaper wrappers, and postal cards; registered letters and
seals; and the examination of Dead Letters and their return
to the writers. Dead letters are those not taken out of the
office to which they were sent. After being advertised three
weeks in some newspaper near the office where they were sent,
they are returned to the General Post Office, where they are
examined; and if they contain money or valuable papers they
are returned to the writers and an account of them kept at the
General Post Office. The sums, so lost and taken care of,
amount annually to tens of thousands of dollars. The Third
Assistant Post Master General has charge of it.</p>

<h5>THE MONEY ORDER OFFICE.</h5>

<p>The Money Orders System furnishes very convenient and
safe banking facilities for the transfer of money in small sums.
It diminishes as much as possible the exposure of money to
loss by theft or otherwise, through the plan of depositing in
one office, and sending a certificate of such deposit which is
good for the money at another office. Immense sums are so
exchanged and business facilitated without any actual passage
of the money from one point to the other. When it is necessary
to preserve the balances it is done by, and at the risk of,
the department.</p>

<p>No more than fifty dollars can be sent in one order, nor more
than three orders to the same person in one day. The number
of these offices is more than 1,400.</p>

<p>The rates of commission on money orders are,</p>

<p>No fractions of cents allowed in orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>When a money order has been lost or destroyed, a duplicate
can be got, by the person who bought the order or by the person
it was bought for, by applying either at the office where the
order was bought or at the office where it should be paid. The
Money Order Department is in charge of the Superintendent
of the Money Order System.</p>

<p>An international money order system, between the United
States and Switzerland, went into operation September 1st,
1869, whereby the exchange of Postal orders between the two
countries is effected through the agency of two Post Offices
termed International Exchange Offices. The Office of New
York City being set apart for the United States, and that of
Basle, in Switzerland, for that country. The amount drawn
for cannot exceed fifty dollars in one order, three orders only
can be obtained by the same person in one day. The system
works satisfactorily, and will no doubt be extended to Great
Britain, and perhaps other European Nations at an early day.</p>

<h5>THE OFFICE OF FOREIGN MAILS.</h5>

<p>It has the care of all foreign postal arrangements and the
supervision of the ocean mail service. It is presided over by
a Superintendent.</p>

<h5>THE AUDITOR OF THE TREASURY FOR THE POST OFFICE
DEPARTMENT.</h5>

<p>This is a bureau of the Treasury Department, which, for
convenience, is located in the General Post Office. To this
officer is assigned the duty of auditing the accounts of the Post
Office Department, all communications relating to the accounts
of postmasters, mail contractors, and other agents of the
Department, are addressed to this officer.</p>

<p>The head of so large and important a department of the
public service is properly a chief officer of the government and
has a seat in the cabinet.</p>

<h5>REGISTERED LETTERS.</h5>

<p>Within the last few years the Registered Letter Department
has grown to enormous proportions. In former times the
registering of a letter was only a notice to those handling
it that it was valuable, the process being to simply paste a Registered
Letter Bill to the letter and place it among the ordinary
letters. If any officer was dishonest and wanted the letter, all
he had to do was to take it and destroy the bill, and the chances
of detection were very slight. The fee was small and the
safety smaller. Under the new system which has been in operation
some few years, and is copied from England, the safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
transmission and delivery of money and valuables is almost
certain. Only letters or other mail matter on which letter
rates of postage are fully prepaid can be registered. Each
postmaster is furnished with all the proper blanks, including
the package envelopes and seals. The latter is a large whitish
brown envelope, longer and broader than an ordinary official
size envelope, and “Registered Letter” printed in large red
letters across the face. The seal is similar to a postage stamp,
only larger, and is placed over the lap after the envelope is
sealed, and then cancelled. When a letter is presented for
registration at any post office, the postmaster must require
that the name and post office address of the writer thereof be
endorsed on its face; he must also see that the postage, as well
as the fee for registering, is fully prepaid by stamps affixed to
such letter; he will then fill out a receipt, entering thereon the
number of the letter, the date and name of his office, the name
and address of the writer, and the address of the letter,
sign and deliver it to the person presenting the letter. The
postmaster then makes out his “registered letter bill”
and “return registered letter bill” each of which contains
a full description of the letter consisting of address
and number. The registered letter bill is then placed in
the package envelope with the letter. The package is then
sealed up and the name of the post office for which it is destined,
and the number and stamp of the mailing office are
plainly marked upon the package. It is then ready for delivery
to the route agent or postal clerk upon whose route it
properly belongs, who is required to give a receipt for it, and
also to keep a complete record of it, as are all officers of the
Department who handle registered matter in transit. He must
also take a receipt from the officer to whom he next delivers
the package. The return registered letter bill is sent in an
ordinary envelope in the regular mail to the office of final
destination, which will, by reason of the fact that no registered
letters are sent in through mails, and only in charge of postal
clerks upon day trains, nearly always reach the office in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of the registered letter; and the postmaster, then knowing
that such letter is on the way, is on the lookout for it, and if it
comes in due time signs the receipt and returns it to the
mailing office. All this is done for a fee of only eight cents
in addition to the regular postage.</p>

<p>If a registered letter should not reach its destination in a
reasonable length of time after the receipt of the return bill,
the post master will notify the post master at the mailing office
of the non-receipt of the letter. It then becomes the duty of
the last mentioned officer to inform a special agent of the fact,
who will make out what is called a “tracer,” which is a complete
description of the letter, with blank space for each person
who handled the original letter to state, from his records
and receipts, exactly what disposition he made of it and whose
receipt he holds; he then passes it along to the next. Thus by
this complete chain of records and receipts, though it may
reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific, a registered letter may
be readily traced to its final destination, or until the records
cease. If a break should occur in the chain and the loss be
fastened upon any post office or mail agent, the case is rigidly
“investigated” by the proper officer, and if it appears that
the loss occurs through carelessness, the loser is made to pay
the value of the lost letter, and receive a severe reprimand,
and if it should occur again is very apt to be dismissed the
service. If the special detective is convinced that the missing
letter is stolen, he then takes a different course and commences
his system of “decoys,” etc., to catch the thief, and is almost
always successful, as the man who robs the mails always
becomes careless, and grows bolder with each repetition of the
offense.</p>

<p>The amount and extent of the registered letter business may
be judged when it is stated that during the month of January,
1874, at the post office in New York over sixty thousand registered
letters were received, nearly thirty thousand of which
were for delivery in the city, and the rest for other places, New
York being a distributing office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<h5>DEAD LETTERS.</h5>

<p>About all that people know or understand of the workings
of the Dead Letter bureau of the Post Office Department is
that if a letter is not delivered in due time it is sent to the
Dead Letter Office, and there opened and returned to the
writer. When, each year, they see the report of the Postmaster
General, the amount of money and number of letters that are
returned to the senders seems enormous, but when it is considered
that millions of letters and thousands of dollars are
carried and safely delivered correctly each year in the United
States, the number that fails of delivery, by contrast, does not
seem so great. During the month of November, 1873, nearly
ten millions of letters were received and dispatched in New
York City.</p>

<p>Every effort is always made to return money or any articles
of value which may be found in dead letters. It is
required that everything valuable shall be registered free when
returned to the owners; but if for any reason it cannot be
delivered to the rightful owner, it is held in the Department
subject to the owners control for four years, and after that time
it is conveyed to the Treasury, and goes towards decreasing the
annual deficit in the Post Office Department. All letters
which are properly stamped and addressed, and go to their destination,
but are not delivered at the end of one week, by reason
of the person addressed not being found, are advertised, either
by publishing once in a daily or weekly paper, or by posting
the list in a conspicuous place in the office. At the end of
four weeks all then undelivered are sent to the dead letter office.
The matter of advertising in newspapers is left to the discretion
of the Postmaster General, and it is but few of the larger
offices that are allowed to do so. The compensation is fixed by
law at one cent for each letter, which is to be paid by the person
receiving the letter; but by reason of the fact that by far
the larger portion of those advertised are not delivered, the
expense is so great that but few offices can be allowed to advertise.
All letters which are dropped into an office without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
stamps or only part paid, or the address is not readable, are
sent at once to the Dead Letter office, except in some few
offices where a bulletin board is provided for the purpose of
displaying to the public letters of this character. When a
letter which is wholly or in part unpaid, and upon which the
address is legible, is found to contain a valuable enclosure a
printed circular is sent to the party addressed requesting that
the requisite amount of postage be forwarded in stamps and
the letter will be forwarded to its proper address.</p>

<p>A great many articles which are of value only to the senders
or the persons for whom they are intended, such as little
baby shoes, stockings, photographs, etc., etc., find their way to
the Dead Letter office. Special effort is always made to deliver
things of this character. Perhaps the little shoe or stocking
may have belonged to some little one whose feet are still forever,
and is being sent to a grandmother or some other near
relation as a memento of the little one that is gone. Such
articles as this may be of no possible value to any one but the
owners, but the post office authorities make as great an effort,
even greater to deliver this class of articles, than they do
money or jewels. At the present time in the Dead Letter
office are great stores of small articles of very little or no
value to any but the owners, waiting to be called for.</p>

<span class="smaller">ATTORNEY GENERAL.</span></h4>

<p>It will be readily perceived that, in a country developing so
rapidly as ours, producing, thereby, an almost unbroken series
of new situations, requiring a cautious application of old
laws and the constant enactment of new ones, and so, a danger
of confusion of legislative rules, that the President and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Cabinet would need a legal adviser of eminent ability, and of
extensive acquirements in legal affairs, to give instruction and
counsel on various lines of action contemplated by the executive
branch of the government, and of the lawful course to be
taken in the numerous particular cases constantly coming up
for determination. Besides, various suits require to be instituted
or defended in the courts, by the government, and some
officer is needed to prosecute or defend them in its name and
interest.</p>

<p>To answer these requirements, the office of Attorney General
was created by the first Congress in 1789. He is a member
of the Cabinet, is nominated by the President, and confirmed
by the Senate, and is removable at the pleasure of the President.
He has an assistant and various clerks to aid him in the
discharge of his responsible duties.</p>

<p>By an act passed in 1861 he is made Superintendent of all
the Attorneys and Marshals in all the Judicial Districts of the
United States. His office is at the seat of Government.</p>

<p>The following is a complete list of the Attorneys General:</p>

<span class="smaller">PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS.</span></h4>

<p>An Elector, in the sense of the Constitution, is one who
has been appointed to choose or elect the President of the
United States. Electors have been chosen in various ways. At
first they were often appointed by the State Legislatures, or
these passed a law directing their election by the people. This
has gradually disappeared, and now the people, by law of Congress
assemble on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November preceding the close of a presidential term, and vote for
the electors. The electors in each State are called its Electoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
College. They meet on the first Wednesday in December following
their election, in their respective States, and vote by
ballot for a President and Vice-President. These cannot both,
according to the Constitution, be citizens of the same State.
They count, certify, and seal these votes and send the sealed
package by a messenger, appointed for that express purpose, to
the President of the United States Senate. On the second
Wednesday in February following, the members of the Senate
and House of Representatives assemble together, the packages
are opened and the votes counted in their presence, and
the result is officially proclaimed. It is evident that this is
now a mere form, and the President and Vice-President are
virtually determined by the people in November. It is not in
harmony with the other parts of our system of government,
which aims at simplicity and practical usefulness, and it will
probably soon be dispensed with. It was originally designed,
by those who framed the Constitution, to act as a check to
party spirit, and was expected to serve a very useful purpose.
They felt the great importance attaching to the office
of Chief Magistrate, on whom they had conferred so much
power, and thought, by this means, to raise his election above
disturbing influences. It was not expected that the candidates
for those offices would come in question, in the popular elections.
The choice was designed to be left with the electors,
with whom, being chosen by the people for that purpose, it was
supposed they would feel safe in leaving it. It was believed
that a select body of eminent men would act with more prudence
and wisdom than the people at large. But the people
felt themselves competent to judge for themselves, and have,
like imperious sovereigns, imposed their choice on the Electors,
so that that part of our constitutional machinery has become
a dead letter. The people know their own minds better, and
are more resolute in imposing their will on their representatives
than was expected; and they have favorably disappointed
the best hopes of those who believed most in their discretion.
So we see that the failure of the Electoral System, planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
by the Fathers of the Republic, is an honorable commentary
on the ability of the people for self-government.</p>

<p>Their success in making their own choice authoritative has
led them to overlook the incongruity of the system, so that
they have never resolutely required it to be abolished. Perhaps
the idea that it might be useful in some important crisis
of national affairs has had an influence to prevent interference
with it. As its retention is attended with considerable expense,
when questions of Economy come to take a leading place in
public policy it is likely to be laid aside, in form, as well as
in fact.</p>

<p>The elections for President, Congressmen, Governors of the
States and their Legislatures, determining the general policy
of the government, and the class of men who shall be appointed
to the various minor offices under its control; those who feel a
strong interest in that policy from their judgment of its
effect on the welfare of the country, or their desire to promote
special measures; and those who are anxious to obtain or hold
office, are very warmly interested in them. They divide into
parties according to their views and exert themselves to the
utmost to influence the result.</p>

<p>Most human affairs have their good and bad side, and this
is not an exception. This party warmth is useful in causing
discussion, examination, and thought, and stirring up the
people to a careful study of their institutions and the principles
of government, and the effect which particular measures
may have on the public welfare. Its tendency, in this direction
is, to make all the people statesmen—a point of the highest
importance in a free government, where the People are
Sovereign. The disadvantage is, that it often awakens an
undue degree of passion and prejudice, the parties and men who
are candidates for office abuse and misrepresent each other in
order to destroy each others influence, when, perhaps, they are
equally in earnest in seeking the good of the country. For
this there is no apparent remedy, but in the intelligence and
good sense of the people themselves. They must learn to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
careful and candid in their judgment of men and measures,
and to examine all sides of a question before rendering a
decision. All should strive toward this intelligent moderation
during important elections.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.</span></h4>

<p>The Presidents of the Continental Congress—as the Legislative
body of the United States was called up to 1789, when the
new Constitution went in effect—were chosen by its members,
which then consisted of only one House, in the same manner
as the Speaker of the House of Representatives is chosen now;
nor was his authority more extensive. He was simply the
presiding officer of a legislative body; and one that had by no
means the effective authority of our present Congress, although
no body in the world ever more deserved the gratitude and
reverence of all time; for it founded and gave direction
and character to a great nation—it may be, the greatest the
world will ever know.</p>

<p>These Presidents had little, except the name, in common
with the Presidents of the United States, as the Constitution
made them. The Presidents were now to be appointed by
the people, and become the depositaries of the Power of the
Nation in Action. It was fit that, in a government deriving
all its authority from the People, as the source of power, its
Special Agent, its acting Representative, should be chosen by
them.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1788 three-fourths of the States had
ratified the Constitution, and it became authoritative as the
Fundamental Law of the country. The Continental Congress,
therefore, closed its own career by ordering elections for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
new Congress, and for the electors who were to appoint the first
President. It directed that these elections should take place
on the first Wednesday in January, 1789; that the electors should
meet on the first Wednesday in February following, to discharge
the duty to which they were appointed; and that, on the first
Wednesday in March, (which, in that year, was the fourth,)
Congress should meet, the President be inaugurated, and the
new government be put in operation.</p>

<p>This brought all these important events close upon the heels
of one another; and on the 4th of March there was not a
quorum of the Members of Congress assembled. The States
lay far apart, and the roads were bad in those times, and at that
season of the year. Though a bare quorum had gathered by
the last of March, and many measures of pressing necessity
were attended to, a full representation was waited for before
the President elect was notified that they were ready for his
inauguration; and that event took place only on the 30th of
April. The presidential term, however, was considered to have
legally commenced at the time previously ordered, and closed
on that day of the year and month; so that it became the first
day of our political year. It commences and closes the President’s
term of office and ends the regular session of Congress.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">First Election, 1789.</span></h5>

<p>There were but 69 electors, and the choice of George Washington
for President, and John Adams for Vice-President, was
unanimous. He had declared, when resigning his commission
as commander-in-chief, that he took leave “of all the employments
of public life,” and only the earnest solicitations of the
leading public men of the time, and their opinion that he
alone could successfully inaugurate the new government,
decided him to leave his cherished retirement. Washington’s
ambition was known to be free from spot or stain of self seeking,
and his moderation and judgment were trusted in as the
sheet anchor of a new government which many feared would
become too strong for the liberties of the people. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
dreaded an abuse of power; but they had no fear of such
abuse while wielded by Washington. There was a solid foundation
to Washington’s fame, in his character.</p>

<p>The presidential electors were mainly chosen by the State
legislatures during the times immediately following the adoption
of the Constitution. That instrument did not decide how
they should be chosen, but left it to the discretion of the State
governments. In some States conventions chose them, and the
practice was various; but after a time it proved to be more
satisfactory to refer the choice directly to the people, and very
soon the people themselves practically selected the President,
the electors being pledged to the choice of the candidate
favored by their constituents, so that their significance was
lost. It is a proof of the <i>popular</i> character of our government.
The system of electors indicated a fear of the people; a want
of confidence in their judgment and self control. The electors,
it was supposed, would be wiser, less accessible to passion
and caprice than those who elected them. The people set
them quietly aside, and proceeded to do their own work themselves,
using the electors only to register their decision. Public
men have seldom ventured to oppose the clearly formed and
definite purposes of the people.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Second Election, 1792.</span></h5>

<p>Washington was again unanimously elected. He desired to
lay down the burdens of office; but so many perplexing
questions and disturbing influences threatened the stability of
the government that he could not be spared. His name and
character were a rock of strength. John Adams was re-elected
Vice-President. Only 11 States had voted at the first election;
North Carolina and Rhode Island not having then ratified the
Constitution. They had now done so, and Vermont and Kentucky
had been admitted, so that there were 15 States voting
at this election. There were 132 electors. Washington
declined another election absolutely, and the government had
proved so suitable as to be fairly settled in the confidence of
the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Third Election, 1796.</span></h5>

<p>Four persons were voted for at this election.</p>

<p>As, by the Constitutional provision regarding electors, the
person having the largest number of votes became President,
and the one who had the next in number became Vice-President,
Adams was now President, and Jefferson Vice-President.
Tennessee had now been admitted into the Union, and
there were 16 States voting.</p>

<p>Conflicting views on foreign policy, and vexing questions of
internal administration began to exert a strong influence, and
party spirit, for the next twenty years, was very bitter. Mr.
Adams was a Federalist; Mr. Jefferson was an anti-Federalist.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Fourth Election, 1800.</span></h5>

<p>The same candidates were again in the field. The political
parties had become clearly defined. Adams and Pinckney
were the Federal candidates, receiving—Adams, 64, Pinckney
63, electoral votes, while Jefferson and Burr had each 73.
They were of the anti-Federal, or Republican party.</p>

<p>The election did not decide which of the two, Jefferson or
Burr, should be President and Vice-President, and, by the
provisions of the Constitution, the House of Representatives
decided it in favor of Jefferson. Party heats were so great
that it took 7 days and 36 ballots to reach this result. It was
felt that there was a defect in the Constitutional provision that
left it undecided, in such a case, which of the candidates was
the choice of the electors for President, and it resulted in the
ratification of the 12th amendment before the next election.</p>

<p>The Federal party never regained the power of administration
lost at this election, though they continued to be a
strong opposition until the close of the war of 1812. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
an opposition, to criticize and point out faults, is often more
useful out of office than in; and the Republican party was
obliged to adopt substantially the general features of the
policy pursued by their predecessors, while they added some
very important ones of their own, in their disposition to
favor popular rights.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Fifth Election, 1804.</span></h5>

<p>Thomas Jefferson and George Clinton were the candidates
of the Republicans. Charles C. Pinckney and Rufus King of
the Federalists.</p>

<p>Jefferson was popular, and received 162 votes—Clinton
receiving the same. Pinckney and King received only 14
votes. The admission of Ohio, in 1802, made 17 States to
vote at this election.</p>

<p>The Federal party was much weaker than in the following
election.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Sixth Election, 1808.</span></h5>

<p>James Madison was the Republican candidate for President,
and Geo. Clinton for Vice-President. Pinckney and
King were again candidates on the part of the Federalists.</p>

<p>Geo. Clinton died before the end of his term. There was the
same number of States voting as in the previous election,
viz.: 17.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Seventh Election, 1812.</span></h5>

<p>Madison was re-elected, with Elbridge Gerry as Vice-President.
They each received 128 electoral votes.</p>

<p>De Witt Clinton and Jared Ingersoll, the candidates of the
Federal party, received, Clinton 89, Ingersoll 57, votes. Louisiana
having been recently admitted into the Union, there
were now 18 States.</p>

<p>War with England was formally declared this year. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
actually begun on the ocean sometime before. It was a very
trying and painful presidential term, owing to the violent
and injudicious opposition made to the measures of the government,
and the unfortunate choice of generals for the first two
years; yet the ultimate result was highly creditable to the
standing and reputation of the United States, and put an
end to the annoying and insulting interferences with our
vessels and commerce that had brought it on. It was a war
waged for the honor and inviolability of our Flag, which was
ever after duly respected.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Eighth Election, 1816.</span></h5>

<p>James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins were the candidates
of the Republicans, who now began to be called Democrats.
The Federalist party was now near its end. It nominated
Rufus King who received 34 electoral votes, Monroe obtaining
183.</p>

<p>Indiana was admitted this year in time to vote, making 19
States. This period marked an important era in the internal
history, as well as foreign relations, of the country. The
period of trial for the Constitution was passed, and full confidence
began to be felt in the system it had founded.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Ninth Election, 1820.</span></h5>

<p>Monroe and Tompkins were re-elected, the vote being substantially
unanimous, for the first and last time since Washington.
The close of this term made the Republican rule in
the administration 24 years in succession, under three Presidents,
each once re-elected, and all citizens of Virginia.</p>

<p>Four new States had been admitted during the previous
term, viz.: Mississippi, Illinois, Alabama, and Maine, so that
23 States took part in this election.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Tenth Election, 1824.</span></h5>

<p>Four candidates were in the field for the presidency at this
election. Missouri having been admitted since the ninth election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
there were 24 States to vote. The whole number of electors
was 261; necessary to a choice, 131.</p>

<p>The candidates and votes were as follows:</p>

<p>By the Constitution the House of Representatives was
required to select the President from the 3 candidates having
the highest number of votes. They were to vote by States,
and a majority of States would elect. J. Q. Adams received
the vote of 13 States, and was declared elected. John C. Calhoun
having received 182 electoral votes for the Vice-Presidency,
was thereby elected to that office. 18 of the States
appointed the electors by popular vote and 6 appointed them
by their legislatures.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Eleventh Election, 1828.</span></h5>

<p>Andrew Jackson was elected President, and John C. Calhoun
re-elected Vice-President.</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams and Richard Rush were also candidates
for President and Vice-President, respectively. The contest
was very hot and bitter. Jackson received 178, and Adams
171 electoral votes. The Popular vote was 650,028 for Jackson
to 512,158 for Adams. The number of electors was the
same as in the 10th election. The most violent excitement
divided the north and the south on the tariff question, which
culminated during this term in the “nullification ordinance,”
which Jackson met with the decision and vigor for which he
was distinguished, ending in the submission of the nullifiers.
Calhoun resigned his office as Vice-President, Dec. 28th,
1832. He was the leader of the nullifiers.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Twelfth Election, 1832.</span></h5>

Mangum. Van Buren’s vote was 762,149 popular, and 170
electoral. Harrison and the others united was 736,736 popular,
and 124 electoral. The whole number of electors being
294, the number necessary to a choice was 148. Johnson
failed by one electoral vote to be elected to the Vice-Presidency,
and the case went to the Senate for decision, as directed by the
Constitution. The remaining electoral votes for Vice-President
being divided between 3 candidates, Johnson was appointed
by the Senate.</p>

again. The country had been passing through a financial
crisis of extreme severity during the thirteenth presidential
term, and this election, involving the decision of a financial
policy, was very exciting.</p>

<p>Harrison was an Ohio farmer, and, the Democrats said,
“lived in a log cabin and drank hard cider.” The Whigs took
the hint, built log cabins to hold their campaign gatherings in,
drank much hard cider, and sung stirring political songs.</p>

<p>This was the third time Mr. Clay had been defeated as a
candidate for the Presidency, to the great regret of many, even
of those who voted against him.</p>

<p>The war with Mexico followed as a consequence of the policy
of the United States government, decided upon in this
election. Texas had formerly been a part of Mexico, and that
country considered its admission into the Union as an act of
hostility to herself.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Sixteenth Election, 1848.</span></h5>

<p>The Whigs were successful in this election, owing to a division
in the ranks of the Democratic party. The Whigs nominated
Gen. Zachary Taylor for President, and Millard Fillmore
for Vice-President; the Democrats Lewis Cass for President,
and Wm. O. Butler for Vice-President; the Free Soil
Democrats—who opposed the extension of slavery—Martin
Van Buren for President, and Charles F. Adams for Vice-President.</p>

<p>The third ticket secured no electoral votes.</p>

<p>Four new States had been admitted into the Union since the
15th election, viz.: Texas, Florida, Iowa, and Wisconsin; and
30 States voted this year.</p>

<p>Gen. Taylor died July 9th, 1850, one year, four months, and
four days after his inauguration, and Mr. Fillmore filled out
his term of office.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Seventeenth Election, 1852.</span></h5>

<p>During the previous Presidential term the subject of slavery,
and the strategy of politicians in favor of and against it,
absorbed public attention. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise
of 1820 opened the whole question, and a trial of
strength as to which side should occupy the new territory, was
prepared for. The crisis of preparation had not been reached
when this election occurred, and comparatively little interest
was taken in it.</p>

<p>The Democrats nominated Franklin Pierce for President,
and Wm. R. King for Vice-President; the Whigs chose as
their candidates Gen. Winfield Scott for President, and Wm.
A. Graham for Vice-President.</p>

<p>Pierce and King received, of popular votes 1,590,490, of
electoral, 254. Scott and Graham received, of popular votes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
1,378,589, of electoral, 42. Pierce’s majority, on popular vote,
211,901, on electoral, 212.</p>

<p>California had been admitted since the 16th election, and
there were 31 States to vote in this.</p>

<p>This was the last election in which the Whig party nominated
a candidate. The contest in regard to slave and free territory
absorbing all the interest of the country, the parties
were rearranged, those in favor of slavery, or wishing to leave
that institution undisturbed, gathered to the Democratic party;
while those wishing to actively oppose the extension of slavery
to territory not yet occupied by it, united, under the name of
the Republican party, the Whigs becoming extinct, as a party.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Eighteenth Election, 1856.</span></h5>

<p>The Democrats nominated James Buchanan, and John C.
Breckenridge for President and Vice-President; the Republicans,
John C. Fremont and William L. Dayton. A third
party, in favor of putting only native Americans in office, voted
for Millard Fillmore and Andrew J. Donnelson. The result
was the following:</p>

<p>Popular vote for Buchanan and Breckenridge 1,803,029,
electoral, 174. Popular vote for Fremont and Dayton 1,342,164,
electoral, 114. Popular vote for Fillmore and Donnelson,
874,625, electoral, 8.</p>

<p>Buchanan had only what is called a plurality popular vote;
the two others united had a majority over him of 413,760
votes. A majority of electoral votes, however, was 149, and
he received 174, and a majority of 52 electoral votes over the
others united.</p>

<p>Only 31 States voted at this election. Mr. Buchanan was
much blamed for not taking more vigorous measures to quench
the secession movement that commenced in the last months
of his administration. The contrast between his course and
Jackson’s in 1832 was very marked.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Nineteenth Election, 1860.</span></h5>

<p>The Republican party nominated Abraham Lincoln for
President, and Hannibal Hamlin for Vice-President. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
south, finding it impossible to uphold the slavery extension
system against the growing Republican party, and the compromise
that had protected that system having been laid aside
in 1850, must submit to the gradual extinction of slavery, or
withdraw from the Union. They chose the latter, and favored
the division of the Democratic party, which was still much
the largest, into several parts. Three tickets of that party
were run, against one in the Republican, which assured the
election of Lincoln.</p>

<p>The Northern Democrats voted mainly for Stephen A. Douglas
and H. V. Johnson; the Southern Democrats for John C.
Breckenridge and Joseph Lane; and those who wished to stop
the contest on the slavery question altogether, on both sides,
voted for John Bell and Edward Everett. The result was as
follows:</p>

<p>The three divisions of the Democrats together had a popular
majority of 947,289 over the Republicans, but the latter
had a majority of 57 electoral votes over all the others united.</p>

<p>Two new States had been admitted since the eighteenth election,
Minnesota and Oregon, and there were 33 States voting.
The census of 1860 gave the population as 31,148,048. All the
votes cast at this election amounted to 4,680,193, the largest
number by more than 500,000 that had ever been known. The
Southern States seceded within a few months, and the Civil
War began. It was remarkable as the most gigantic war of
its kind, perhaps of any kind, known in history; and for the
obstinate bravery and resolution displayed on both sides. It
continued during this entire presidential term.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Twentieth Election, 1864.</span></h5>

<p>The election this year was confined to the States that had
remained loyal to the Constitution and the Union. Eleven
States had seceded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>The Republicans re-nominated Lincoln for President, with
Andrew Johnson for Vice-President. The Democratic party
nominated Gen. Geo. B. McClellan for President, and Geo. H.
Pendleton for Vice-President. The result was as follows:</p>

<p>The total number of popular votes was 4,034,789. Lincoln’s
vote at this election was the largest that had ever been cast for
one candidate, though there were less votes cast by all parties by
600,000 than in the nineteenth election. Two new States,
Kansas and West Virginia, had been admitted since the previous
election, which with the 11 in rebellion omitted, left 24
States voting.</p>

<p>The civil war closed with the submission of the seceded
States to the general government soon after Lincoln’s re-inauguration;
but he was assassinated about the same time, on the
evening of April 13th, 1865, and died on the following day,
leaving a nation in mourning, and the civilized world struck
with horror. Andrew Johnson acted as President during the
remainder of this term. Mr. Johnson’s administration was
marked by the great difference in the policy of reconstructing
the seceded States adopted by him and by the Congress, by the
limitations which the latter threw around him, and the attempt
to impeach him, which failed by a few votes.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Twenty-First Election, 1868.</span></h5>

<p>Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was nominated by the Republicans
for President, and Schuyler Colfax for Vice-President.</p>

<p>The nominees of the Democratic party were Horatio Seymour
and Francis P. Blair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>Grant’s popular majority was 309,588. Questions of reconstruction
and finance were determined by this election, the
people upholding the policy pursued by Congress since the
close of the war.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Twenty-Second Election, 1872.</span></h5>

<p>Grant was nominated by the Republican party for President,
and Henry Wilson for Vice-President. The Democrats
nominated Horace Greeley for President, and B. Gratz Brown
for Vice-President. A second Democratic party had a ticket,
nominating Chas. O’Connor and J. Q. Adams.</p>

<p>Grant’s popular majority was 762,991; and he received 218
electoral votes. 30 States gave him majorities, Pennsylvania
reaching 137,000 majority in his favor. The whole popular
vote at this election was 6,431,149. The colored people voted
for the first time, under the amendment to the Constitution
abolishing the distinction in citizenship in regard to color.</p>

<p>The elections are now held on the same day in all the States,
by a general law. The number of States voting at the 22d
election was thirty-seven. This election set a final seal on the
policy of the Republican party, leaving the country free to
turn its attention to other questions relating to its internal
interests.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONGRESS.</span></h4>

<p>1. All government consists of three steps, series, or
departments. It has a Rule by which its action is governed;
and this embraces the general principles guiding
all action, as well as the special rules of conduct in regard
to limited classes of actions—the next step in the series
is the action demanded to put its rules in actual force—to
apply them—the third is, to determine the application of
the rule when supposed to be violated, and the agreement
of the special rule with the general principle. That is to say,
government is divided into the Legislative, or law making
power; the Executive, or law enforcing power; and the Judicial,
or law discriminating, or judging, power.</p>

<p>2. In some governments all these are in the same hands, and
this produces a Despotism. In others they are variously divided
or mixed. In our country the separation between them is
made as distinct as possible. The People are regarded as the
source or fountain of Power. The Constitution represents, in
its general Principles or Rules, the Will and purposes of the
People; and outside of the principles or regulations of this
instrument no legislation is valid. The Constitution, emanating
from the people, defines the boundary of all the
Departments. Congress is the law-making power, enacting
within the prescribed limits. The Judiciary takes care that
these limits are not overstepped by legislative enactments, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
executive action. The executive power, or the President, is
the concentrated force, the vigorous Arm, of the government.</p>

<p>It is Congress, the Legislative Authority, that we have now
to consider.</p>

<p>3. The National Congress is a body of men representing,
and acting in the place of, the people. They are elected by the
people to enact laws for the public good—to do all—and no
more nor less—than the people would do, if it were possible
for them to assemble in one great body and make the laws by
which they wish to be governed.</p>

<p>It was constituted as wisely, to guard against the errors to
which humanity is liable, as the experience of the past permitted
to the thoughtful and patriotic statesmen who had
charge of the organization of the government, when the successful
termination of the War of Independence left the interests
of a new Nation in their hands. England, from which
they had mostly sprung, and which governed them until that
period, was in possession of the freest and most enlightened
government of those times, in the Old World; and they copied
from her institutions and general structure what they judged
adapted to our circumstances; prudently avoiding untried
experiments, as far as possible.</p>

<p>4. Congress, like the English Parliament, consists of two
Houses, one, the House of Representatives, (answering to the
English House of Commons) being directly elected, for a short
term, by the people, so as to express their views and interests
as clearly as possible; the other, the Senate, (answering partially
to the English House of Lords) appointed by the State
Legislatures for a longer term, and from among statesmen of
acknowledged ability and mature character and experience.
This was expected to supply the necessary check to hasty and
ill considered action, as they were required to mutually agree
on all laws enacted.</p>

<p>5. Both are required to assemble, at the same time, in the
Capitol at Washington, on the first Monday in December of
each year. This is the regular session—extra sessions being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
occasionally called by the President when unusual circumstances
demand it.</p>

<p>The members of the House of Representatives are elected
for two years, the members of the Senate for six. As the first
contains by far the largest number, a Congress is said to exist
for two years, and the 20th Congress would be the one existing
during the 40th and 41st years of the Republic, dating from
the first Congress in 1789.</p>

<h5>THE SENATE</h5>

<p>6. Is composed of two persons, chosen by the legislature
of each State, to represent it as a whole. It makes no difference
whether the State be large or small, whether population
counts by the million or the thousand. The States are sovereign
in their sphere, and this constitution of the Senate
keeps that fact in view, operates against undue centralization
of power, and oppression of the smaller States by the larger.</p>

<p>7. A Senator must be thirty years of age, must have been
nine years a citizen, (he may have been born in a foreign State,
and a citizen of it previously,) and must be a citizen of the
State—(a voter in it) at the time of appointment. He is
appointed for six years. The Senate is arranged in three
classes so that the terms of one-third of the whole number
shall expire every two years. They may be re-elected as often
as the State legislatures choose. In one case, a Senator was
continued thirty years in the Senate, without intermission. It
has equal legislative power with the House of Representatives,
except that it cannot originate laws for raising money, but it
must approve and adopt all laws made by the House to render
them valid. It has some powers that do not belong to the
House. It confirms or rejects the nominations of the President,
to office, and the treaties he makes with foreign powers,
and is the only High Court of Impeachment.</p>

<p>8. When the Senate meets to consider the nominations of
the President to office, it is called an Executive Session, and
only a majority of votes is required to approve or confirm
them; but when a treaty is to be ratified, or judgment given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
in a case of impeachment, a vote of two-thirds of the members
present is required.</p>

<p>The Vice-President of the United States is the presiding
officer of the Senate; but in case of a vacancy in that office,
when he is acting as President, or if he be absent, it chooses
a president from its own members.</p>

<h5>THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</h5>

<p>9. Is composed of persons elected by the people in the
various States, in proportion to the number of inhabitants. A
Representative is elected for a term of two years. He must
be twenty-five years of age, must have been a citizen of the
United States seven years, and must be a citizen of the State
he represents. This is often called the “Lower House,” or
popular branch of the National Legislature, as the Senate is
sometimes called the “Upper House,” because it is more select,
and greater in dignity.</p>

<p>10. The House of Representatives has the sole power of
presenting articles of Impeachment, and it alone can originate
laws for raising revenue. A larger part of the laws are actually
originated in it, because it is more numerous, its members better
known to the people whom they immediately represent, and
the people are better acquainted with them; and more petitions
for particular laws are sent to them. Each representative
is voted for by the people of his Congressional District
alone, and not by all the people of each State; and he specially
represents the views and wants of his District.</p>

<p>In each branch of Congress, when a Bill, or plan of a law,
has been passed, it is sent to the other House, where it is
referred to a Committee who examine it, and report on it to the
House; by which it is discussed and adopted, amended, or
rejected according to its judgment, and returned to the House
in which it originated. By this method every law is meant to
be subjected to a careful and cool investigation, its defects discovered
and corrected, and its appropriateness clearly made
manifest. Whoever will examine, with care and thoroughness
the whole structure of our government will everywhere discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
traces of the same wisdom and watchful foresight. He
will see reason for more admiration of the prudent statesmanship
of those who organized our institutions, and feel less surprised
at the wonderful prosperity of the country, and at the
strength of the government when subjected to the severest
trial. Everything human is more or less imperfect, and we
shall never be without subjects of complaint, and opportunities
for improvement; but every American, well informed concerning
his own and foreign governments, will discover many
weighty reasons for self-congratulation and pride that our first
statesmen and people were so wise and prudent in laying the
foundation, and that their successors have built on it with so
much skill.</p>

<p>11. The presiding officer in the House of Representatives
is called “The Speaker,” and is chosen by the House, at
the beginning of each Congress. He serves during its two
years of existence. The Clerk of the House and its minor
officers are chosen by its members—and each House makes
its own rules, or Parliamentary Laws. The term Congress
properly covers both branches of the National Legislature;
but, by custom, the members of the upper house are called
Senators, and those of the lower Members of Congress, (commonly
abbreviated to M. C.)</p>

<p>12. The Compensation of Members of Congress was originally
fixed at eight dollars a day, but has, of late years, been
several times changed. In 1856 it was made $3,000 per session,
or $6,000 for a Congress of two years. In 1866 it was
increased to $5,000 per session, and, in 1873 to $7,500 per
session, the Speaker of the House, and the President of the
Senate, by this last law, receiving $10,000 per year; but it
produced so much dissatisfaction among the people that
the law was changed at the following session, and they now
receive $5,000 per annum.</p>

<p>13. The members of each house receive the same compensation.
Mileage is allowed them in addition to the salary.
This has been forty cents per mile, by the usual routes between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the members residence and Washington. In 1865 it was
reduced to twenty cents per mile, which still seems more
adapted to the days of stages and slow traveling than to the
modern improvements in rapidity and cheapness. They formerly
enjoyed the franking privilege, so called, i. e.: they
could send letters and documents through the mails free. This
was abolished in 1873, and they now pay their postage, the
same as other people.</p>

<p>14. The first Congress under the Constitution met in New
York City, where two sessions were held, when it was removed
to Philadelphia. It remained there until 1800, when Washington
became the capital. The Capitol there, in which Congress
meets, is one of the largest buildings in the world;
and the offices for the different executive Departments are
immense structures. In 1874 there were 37 States and therefore
74 Senators. The number of Representatives was fixed
by a law of March, 1873, at 292, at which number it will
remain until the next census in 1880.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS—CONGRESSMEN.</span></h4>

<p>1. Each State is entitled to a number of Representatives in
Congress proportioned to its inhabitants; but, instead of counting
the whole number together, and leaving all the people in the
State to vote for all the representatives of their State, it is divided
into districts, each containing the prescribed number entitled
to representation. The voters, then, in each district, select or
nominate the men they wish to vote for—and thus they find it
easy to send men they know and on whom they can rely to
secure their interests. Besides, it is more convenient for them
to meet and ascertain by consultation who would be most
acceptable to the majority of those interested. Each Member
of Congress, therefore, is chosen by a single district. The districting
of States is done by their State Legislatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Sometimes a State is admitted into the Union before it
has as many inhabitants as the law requires to one Congressman,
in which case the law is relaxed, and they are permitted
at least one Representative. Contiguous counties or towns are
set apart in this way and numbered as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, &amp;c.,
Congressional District. In large cities as many wards, lying
together, as include the requisite number, are erected into Districts.
In case the number of Congressmen allotted to a State
is larger than the number of districts, those in excess are voted
for by the State at large. They are arranged as soon as possible
after every census, so that this does not often occur. In
the Western States the number continually increases and
changes must be made after each census. By this means the
balance of power gradually follows the emigration from East
to West.</p>

<h5>CONGRESSMEN.</h5>

<p>3. We have already remarked, in the chapter on Congress
that, though the term Congressman properly applies to the
members of both Houses, it is by common usage, confined to
members of the lower House, those of the upper House being
distinguished as Senators, so that the abbreviation M. C. (Member
of Congress) is understood to specify a Representative.</p>

<p>4. These are the only members of any branch of the government
who are chosen and elected directly by the people, and
we may see herein the propriety of their having the control of all
enactments for raising money, this being a point of vital interest
to the people. The short term assigned them, (two years,)
and their election by Districts, enables the people to interfere
very soon if their purse strings are drawn too widely open—a
very satisfactory reflection to the economical. Any citizen,
whether native or foreign born, may become a Member of Congress,
if he can obtain the consent of the voters in his district;
but he must have been a citizen during the previous seven
years. It is an office of dignity and responsibility, and the
welfare of the country depends on the wisdom of the people
in their choice.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY.</span></h4>

<p>1. In the capitol there is a large library, consisting of two
parts; one part called the Congressional library, the other, the
law library. The latter is made a part of the former by an
act of Congress. Both are subject to the same laws and rules,
and both are supported by appropriations made by Congress.</p>

<p>This institution, called as a whole, “The Congressional
Library,” contains the works supposed to be useful to legislators,
but is not confined to their use alone. Its use has been
extended to the judges of the Supreme Court; to all the heads
of departments; to the Attorney General; to all the members
of the diplomatic corps, (foreign ministers); to the secretary
of the Senate; to the clerk of the House of Representatives, to
the chaplains of Congress, to all ex-Presidents, and to the
solicitor of the Treasury.</p>

<p>2. It has a librarian, appointed by the President and Senate,
who is allowed to appoint two assistants. No book or
map is allowed to be taken out of the library by any person,
except the President, Vice-President, members of the Senate
and of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>People in general, who are interested to do so, may obtain
information from the books and records when properly authorized,
under such restrictions as the circumstances require.</p>

<p>3. Here are kept all the laws which have ever been enacted
by Congress, together with a record of all its proceedings, the
laws of all the different States, with many of those of foreign
countries; also a large collection of books on promiscuous subjects,
useful to Members of Congress and to those who have
to administer the government. No where else can so complete
a history of the acts and proceedings of the government
be found, as in the Congressional library at Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>This institution dates back to the year 1800, when an act
was passed making the first appropriation of $5,000 for its
establishment. The books purchased with this $5,000, with
those belonging to both Houses, were placed together, and
thus this library was commenced.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">COPYRIGHTS.</span></h4>

<p>A Copyright is an exclusive privilege given to any citizen,
or resident in the United States to print, publish, or sell any
book, map, chart, engraving, or musical composition of which
he or she is the author or proprietor. This right is given by
the laws of Congress. No State can give it. The object is to
encourage authors, and to compensate them for their labors,
which they could not be sure of obtaining if any one might
publish and sell their productions. A copyright conveys all
the rights of ownership, and may be bought and sold like other
property.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Directions for Securing Copyrights under the Revised Act
of Congress, which took effect July 8, 1870.</span></h5>

<p>1. A printed copy of the title of the book, map, chart,
dramatic or musical composition, engraving, cut, print, photograph,
or a description of the painting, drawing, chromo,
statue, statuary, or model or design for a work of the fine
arts, for which copyright is desired, must be sent by mail,
prepaid, addressed, “Librarian of Congress, Washington,
D. C.” This must be done before publication of the book or
other article.</p>

<p>2. A fee of 50 cents, for recording the title of each book or
other article, must be inclosed with the title as above, and 50
cents in addition (or $1 in all) for each certificate of copyright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
under the seal of the Librarian of Congress, which will be
transmitted by return mail.</p>

<p>3. Within ten days after publication of each book or other
article, two complete copies of the best edition issued must
be sent, to perfect the copyright, with the address</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Librarian of Congress, Washington, D. C.</span></p>

<p>It is optional with those sending books and other articles to
perfect copyright, to send them by mail or express; but, in
either case, the charges are to be prepaid by the senders.
Without the deposit of copies above required, the copyright is
void, and a penalty of $25 is incurred. No copy is required
to be deposited elsewhere.</p>

<p>4. No copyright hereafter issued is valid unless notice is
given by inserting in every copy published, on the title page
or the page following, if it be a book; or, if a map, chart,
musical composition, print, cut, engraving, photograph, painting,
drawing, chromo, statue, statuary, or model or design
intended to be perfected as a work of the fine arts, by inscribing
upon some portion of the face or front thereof, or on the
face of the substance on which the same is mounted, the following
words, viz.: <i>Entered according to act of Congress,
in the year ____, by ____, in the office of the Librarian
of Congress, at Washington.</i></p>

<p>The law imposes a penalty of $100 upon any person who has
not obtained copyright who shall insert the notice “<i>Entered
according to act of Congress</i>,” etc., or words of the same
import, in or upon any book or other article.</p>

<p>5. Any author may reserve the right to translate or dramatize
his own work. In this case notice should be given by
printing the words, <i>Right of translation reserved</i>; or, <i>All
rights reserved</i>, below the notice of copyright entry, and notifying
the Librarian of Congress of such reservation, to be
entered upon the record.</p>

<p>6. Each copyright secures the exclusive right of publishing
the book or article copyrighted for a term of twenty-eight
years. At the end of that time, the author or designer, or his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
widow or children, may secure a renewal for the further term
of fourteen years, making forty-two years in all. Applications
for renewal must be accompanied by explicit statement of ownership
in the case of the author, or of relationship in the case
of his heirs, and must state definitely the date and place of
entry of the original copyright.</p>

<p>7. The time within which any work copyrighted may be
issued from the press is not limited by any law or regulation,
but depends upon the discretion of the proprietor. A copyright
may be secured for a projected work as well as for a completed
one.</p>

<p>8. Any copyright is assignable in law by any instrument
of writing, but such assignment must be recorded in the office
of the Librarian of Congress within sixty days from its date.
The fee for this record is fifteen cents for every 100 words, and
ten cents for every 100 words for a copy of the record of assignment.</p>

<p>9. A copy of the record (or duplicate certificate) of any
copyright entry will be furnished under seal, at the rate of
fifty cent each.</p>

<p>10. In the case of books published in more than one volume,
if issued or sold separately, or of periodicals published in
numbers, or of engravings, photographs, or other articles published
with variations, a copyright is to be taken out for each
volume of a book, or number of a periodical, or variety, as to
size or inscription, of any other article.</p>

<p>11. To secure a copyright for a painting, statue, or model
or design intended to be perfected as a work of the fine arts,
so as to prevent infringement by copying, engraving, or vending
such design, a definite description must accompany the
application for copyright, and a photograph of the same, at
least as large as “cabinet size,” must be mailed to the Librarian
of Congress within ten days from the completion of the
work.</p>

<p>12. Every applicant for a copyright must state distinctly
the name and residence of the claimant, and whether the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
is claimed as author, designer, or proprietor. No affidavit or
formal application is required.</p>

<p>Up to 1849 the Secretary of State had the care of issuing
copyrights. It was then assigned to the newly created Department
of the Interior, and so remained until 1870, when it was
transferred to the Librarian of Congress.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L.<br />
<span class="smaller">PRESIDING OFFICERS OF CONGRESS.</span></h4>

<p>1. These are the President of the Senate and the Speaker
of the House of Representatives. The latter is chosen by
ballot of the Members of the House. As this position gives
him considerable influence over the course of legislation the
party having a majority in the House are careful to select one
on whose sympathy with their views and aims they can rely.
When there is nearly or quite a balance of parties, it becomes
an important and difficult matter to adjust; and has, in some
instances, required a long struggle to elect the Speaker. The
result, in such a case, usually determines which shall control
the general legislation of that Congress.</p>

<p>2. The President of the Senate, under ordinary circumstances,
is determined by the Constitution, that instrument devolving
the office on the Vice-President. It is the only active duty
assigned him while the President is in condition to perform
the duties belonging to that office. It seems to befit his relations,
being the highest honorary place in the government
below that of President, subjects him to no superior, and, from
the part the Senate takes in the responsibilities of the President,
makes him acquainted with the general conduct of
affairs; which may be an important advantage to him should
he be called to act as President. In the latter case, and in case
of the decease, resignation, or disability of the Vice-President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the Senate proceeds to elect its President in the same way as
in the House of Representatives, i. e.: by ballot, for a candidate
among its own members.</p>

<p>3. Their duties are to open every sitting of their respective
Houses by calling the members to order at the appointed time,
on the appearance of a quorum to cause the journal of the
preceding day to be read, to preserve order and decorum during
the deliberations, to decide questions of order that may arise,
(from which an appeal may be taken to the House, at the
instance of any two members,) to formally state, and call for
the votes on, a question to be decided, and to declare the result
of the same after the vote has been taken.</p>

<p>This is the regular routine duty of a presiding officer. They,
as the recognized Heads of their respective Houses, have the
general oversight of its interests, and a general control of the
conduct of its business. They examine the Journal to see
that it is correct, may order the galleries and lobby to be cleared
in case of any disturbance by spectators, and have general
control over the unoccupied rooms in the capitol belonging to
their respective Houses. They are required to sign all acts,
addresses, and joint resolutions, and appoint the members of
all committees whose appointment is not specially directed by
the House to be otherwise made. In all cases of ballot the
Speaker of the House must vote; but he is not required to
vote in other cases unless there is a tie, (an equal number for
and against,) when he must give the casting vote. The President
of the Senate may vote only in case of a tie.</p>

<p>When the House of Representatives goes into Committee of
the Whole, the Speaker leaves the chair, but appoints a chairman
to preside for the time being; and when the President of
the United States is impeached before the Senate the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court presides.</p>

<p>4. Their duties are very distinctly defined in the rules
adopted by each House for their guidance, but many opportunities
for exerting great influence often arise, and many cases
requiring great tact and judgment and an intimate knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
of Parliamentary Law. They receive a much larger salary
than ordinary Members of Congress.</p>

<p>The following are the names of all the Speakers of the
House of Representatives. A list of Vice-Presidents is given
in the chapter devoted to that officer.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUBORDINATE OFFICERS OF CONGRESS.</span></h4>

<p>1. The Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of
Representatives, are the officers next in rank in the two bodies
forming Congress. They are appointed by vote of their
respective Houses. They are not necessarily selected from
among the members of the Senate or House, as is the custom
in case of the presiding officers, but may be chosen by the
members at will.</p>

<p>2. Their chief duties are in connection with a record or
journal of the proceedings of their respective Houses. This
is an official and correct account of all the transactions of each
body, is examined by the presiding officer, and read before the
members for criticism and approval. They cause this journal
to be printed and a copy be delivered to each member at the
commencement of every session of Congress, as also to the
Executive and to each branch of the Legislature of every State.
So also they arrange, cause to be printed, and distribute to the
members all the current documents of each House that may be
useful to them in the discharge of their duties, as often as the
case requires. All contracts for furnishing anything required
by Congress, or for any labor done for it, are made with,
or approved by, the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the
Senate.</p>

<p>3. They act also as treasurers of the special, or contingent
funds of Congress, from which payments are made on their
order, after the accounts, on which the order is based, are
approved by the Committee of Accounts; and give bonds in a
large sum for the faithful use of these funds, making a detailed
report of all expenditures.</p>

<h5>THE SERGEANT-AT-ARMS</h5>

<p>4. Is a kind of police and executive officer, who aids or acts
under the direction of the presiding officer in keeping order,
and executes the commands of Congress. All arrests ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
by Congress are made by him or his deputies, and all legal
processes served by him. He bears a mace as the symbol of
his office when on duty. He keeps the accounts of the pay and
mileage of the members of Congress, prepares checks, and
draws and pays the money to them.</p>

<p>5. The other officers are a Doorkeeper—whose business it
is to see that only the proper persons gain admission to the
sessions of Congress, and watches over, and is responsible for,
the furniture contained in the rooms of the capitol placed in
his charge—and a postmaster, whose business it is to superintend
a postoffice kept in the capitol for the accommodation of
members of Congress. Various clerks, deputies, and messengers
are employed under most of these officers, to aid them in
the discharge of their duties.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONGRESS AT WORK.</span></h4>

<p>1. Congress is required by the Constitution to assemble on
the first Monday in December of each year. It may, by a law
duly made to that effect, change that time, but no permanent
change has ever been made. As soon after that time as a quorum
of its members, which the Constitution declares shall be
a majority of each House, has assembled each House proceeds
to the election of officers (which, however, is done only every
other year,) and the arrangement of its committees, and it is
ready for work.</p>

<p>2. As soon as the organization is ascertained to be complete
the other House of Congress and the President are informed of
the fact, after which propositions, or bills as they are called,
of new laws, or repeals or revisals of old ones are entertained.
Of these there is never any lack. They are taken up in regular
order, referred to an appropriate committee for examination,
a report is in due time made by the committee, discussed
at such length as the members see cause for, in a regular manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
and finally are voted on. Sometimes, if the members are
not satisfied with the information presented on some point or
points, they return them to the committee with instructions to
investigate further, and make another report; sometimes they
“lay them on the table,” that is, put them aside for future
action; or they accept, amend, or change them to meet their
views, and then accept or reject them altogether.</p>

<p>3. When a bill has reached a vote and been accepted by the
House in which it originated, it is sent to the other House, by
which it is taken up, referred to a committee, usually passing
through substantially the same course and form of consideration
as in the first case, laid aside, amended, accepted or
rejected according to circumstances, and returned to the former
House. If it is accepted by both they then send it to the
President, who carefully considers it. If it meets his approbation,
he signs and returns it to Congress, and it becomes the
Law of the Land, and all to whom it refers are bound to obey
it, it being the duty of the President to see that it is enforced.
It is called an “Act of Congress,” because it is the proper
exercise of its law making authority, and because all such laws
are preceded by the clause, “Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the United States of America, in
Congress assembled.”</p>

<p>4. If the President does not think it a suitable law, and is
unwilling to assume the responsibility of signing it, he returns
it to Congress, with his reasons for not doing so. If Congress
is not satisfied with these reasons it may take another vote on
it, and if the members in its favor amount to two-thirds of
each House, it becomes a law without the signature of the
President. This power of the President to decline to sign a
law of Congress is called his “Veto.” Sometimes it is carried
over the veto, and sometimes it fails for lack of the requisite
number in its favor.</p>

<p>5. The larger part of Congressional laws are passed in this
way, which is the regular Parliamentary form; but sometimes
its authority is expressed by a Resolution instead of a bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
This is a kind of informal way of passing a law, though it
usually takes that form because of the peculiar character of
the subject of the Resolution; as an amendment to the Constitution
would be commenced by a resolution passed by both
Houses; but, as Congress has not the sole power over that
question, it requiring the concurrence of three fourths of the
States, it is put in that form. When some demand is to be
made by Congress on the President, or on various officers of
the government, and in a variety of other cases, a resolution
has the force of law, disobedience to which would involve a
penalty. Many resolutions merely express the views of Congress,
and are of force and value only on account of the respectability
and dignity of the body expressing them. Some resolutions
require to be passed in both Houses to acquire legal
force, and are then called Concurrent Resolutions.</p>

<p>A bill must pass through the regular forms of printing,
reference to a committee, report, placing in order on the records,
and calling up at a proper time for consideration and decision.
This is very proper to avoid hasty action before all the bearings
of the case have been examined; but would consume too much
time if required in every case. A resolution may be debated
and decided at once, and it facilitates the progress of business,
in the class of cases to which it is applicable.</p>

<p>6. The amount of business to be done by Congress is
immense. Each branch of the executive department makes a
yearly report to it, which must be considered and suitable laws
passed; many hundreds of laws are commonly asked to be
passed, repealed, or revised, by the President or the people;
and all the interests of a great and growing country looked
after. Those who are at a distance cannot always judge accurately
of the difficulties it meets with in endeavoring to give
satisfaction to all, nor of the different appearance which questions
may present when closely examined and looked at
on all sides, and Congress has a great deal of short-sighted
criticism to bear.</p>

<p>Congressmen cannot always tell what is best more than other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
people, nor always find themselves able to do what they prefer,
or judge to be best, and the account to which they are held is
sometimes unjust; yet, on the whole they have always respected,
and sought to serve, the views and interests of the people as a
whole, and deserve much praise. The country has become
prosperous and free under their legislation, and what the majority
of the people clearly call for is always done for them.</p>

<p>7. The more carefully the people whom they represent
watch them at work, and study the subjects they are required
to legislate on, the less reason will they find for denunciation
of them, and the more intelligently will they be able to lay
out their work for them. They are the servants of the people,
notwithstanding they seem to command and order, and are
liable to be dismissed and turned out of place if they do not
give satisfaction. They are men like ourselves, with interests,
temptations, and weaknesses. We should aid them in their
work, and assist them to walk uprightly by our intelligence
and careful regard for reason and right. Our representatives
will always, in character and conduct, present a fair statement
of what we are ourselves. If we are just, honest, and high-minded
they will not dare to be otherwise than faithful and
true, and if we are intelligent we shall never put ignorant and
vile men in office. So the Congress of the United States of
America will always be a truly Representative Body.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">PUBLIC PRINTING.</span></h4>

<p>1. Among the Institutions of the government is that heading
this chapter. The amount of printing required to be done
for Congress, the various branches of the government, and for
the benefit of the people, is very great indeed. All the proceedings
of both Houses of Congress as recorded by the secretaries
are required to be printed under authority; since many
copies are required by the members and for general purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
All the laws are printed in great numbers for circulation among
the many millions interested; and when a bill is proposed it
requires to be printed for the use of the several hundred members
who need it for examination and study, although it often
never becomes a law.</p>

<p>2. The President’s Messages, and all the reports of heads
of departments and bureaus; the reports and commissions of
army and navy officers, of investigating committees, of various
superintendents, agents, and government employees, and many
other things are printed, sometimes only for use of Congress;
sometimes for extensive circulation. Thus it is easily seen that
the government printing is a heavy expense, and a very large
part is indispensable; though many believe that a judicious
selection of documents and a careful study as to the number
of some of them printed might largely reduce the expense,
without injury to the public welfare. We do not wish to pay
for the printing of documents that are never read. It is a
waste of the people’s money; yet, we must not forget that it is
of the utmost importance that the people should become intimately
acquainted with all the affairs of the government. Perhaps
Congress is sometimes wiser than the people, and that
many documents are wisely printed, and unwisely left unread
by those most interested. Economy and intelligence are to be
equally regarded.</p>

<p>3. Until 1860, the government hired men to do this work,
and a printer was employed by each house of Congress. But
great complaints were made of the enormous expense to which
the country was subjected in this item of its expenditures; and
at the date named, Congress passed an act establishing a government
printing office, to be under the direction of a superintendent
of public printing. The sum of $150,000 was appropriated
for the purchase of necessary buildings, machinery, and
materials for the purpose. By the provisions of the act it was
made the superintendent’s duty to overlook all the public
printing and binding, not only of Congress, but of all the
departments, and of the United States courts; to purchase all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
necessary materials and to employ all the workmen required.
And that Congress may know how the establishment is conducted
and at what expense, the superintendent is required to
report to Congress at the commencement of every session, the
work done, the number of hands employed, and the exact state
and condition of the establishment. He is prohibited from
paying more for work done in this office than is given for the
same services in private printing offices in Washington.</p>

<p>4. The superintendent is also charged with the duty of procuring
all blank books, maps, drawings, diagrams, views, and
charts, which may be ordered by Congress, or by the heads of
departments and bureaus. But the superintendent himself is
not left to act always as he may think proper, for in many cases
he must have the approval of the joint committee on printing
of both Houses of Congress.</p>

<p>5. This is a very proper effort to curtail expenses. It
remains to be seen how successful it may be. The constant
watchful oversight of the Sovereign People can alone succeed
in keeping all things in due order. When the representatives
of the people become careless and wasteful the admonition of
the people is never without its effect.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LIV">CHAPTER LIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SIGNAL SERVICE.</span></h4>

<p>1. The present organization of this institution dates from
the beginning of the civil war, and was originally purely military
in its aims and purposes. It is still conducted by the
War Department, and partly for its own purposes; but its
value to agricultural and commercial interests is constantly
becoming more apparent and more extensive, and will probably,
in the end, so overshadow its military relations as to reduce
them to a very subordinate place in importance. The civil
uses of this service are based on the science of meteorology,
which is largely occupied with weather changes, the origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
progress, and laws of Storms. Its value to the people consists
in its accurate prediction of changes in the weather, and the
warning it is able to give, sometimes many hours or even days
in advance, of dangerous storms. Its estimate of weather
probabilities, based on observations reported daily from prominent
points covering the whole country, are published in all
the daily papers, usually found accurate, and are of great value
to certain classes of the people. When a storm threatens to
endanger the safety of shipping a signal is displayed in the
port to give warning, and much property and many lives are
often saved. It makes an accurate and scientific study of the
weather and all the laws controlling its changes, by a large corps
of enlightened and trained observers, all whose facts, constantly
reported, systematized, and studied by competent persons, are
likely to produce, in time, a most important and useful body
of knowledge on that subject.</p>

<p>2. The objects of the Signal Service require its officials to
be connected with the United States army, to have the use of
the Electric Telegraph, to be familiar with Meteorology, and
skillful in the use of the scientific instruments employed in the
study of atmospheric changes. By means of the telegraph,
the army, though scattered over the whole country, and especially
the frontiers and more inaccessible parts, may be almost instantaneously,
and all at the same time, communicated with. It
would be possible, by telegraphs, signals, and railroads, to concentrate
the whole army from the numerous points where its
fragments are located, from Maine to Texas, and the Atlantic
to the Pacific, at one point in as short a time as it formerly
took a body of soldiers to march a hundred miles.</p>

<p>3. It is a singularly striking instance of the vigor and
effectiveness of control supplied by science, invention, and
modern progress, by which our vast increase in numbers and
in extent of territory are neutralized, the interests, sentiments,
and habits of the people unified so that sectional jealousies and
contests are made rare and slight, and the people of remote
parts of the country made practically better acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
each other than formerly were the inhabitants of adjoining
States.</p>

<p>4. Subordination and thoroughness of system are secured
by its connection with the army, which probably also secures
its advantages to the country at much less cost than would be
the case were it an independent institution. The army is ambitious
to be as useful as possible to the country. There is a
Signal School of Instruction and Practice at Fort Whipple, in
Va., which is to this Service what the Military and Naval
Academies are to the Army and Navy. The most suitable persons
are selected from the army or especially enlisted, and carefully
schooled and tested through a sufficiently long period to
render them fully competent for the delicate duties imposed on
them.</p>

<p>5. There are about 90 Signal Stations, a few being located
in Canada and the West Indies. The whole is under the direction
of the Chief Signal Officer, who reports to the Secretary
of War. There is a large and carefully arranged organization,
under constant supervision by competent persons. Several
Boards of Examination are employed in selecting suitable
persons for the different duties required in the Service, and in
testing their advancement toward a thorough fitness for each
position to be occupied.</p>

<p>The first or lowest grade is for the “field” signal service,
requiring a knowledge of army signals and telegraphy—this
being the original military value of the institution—the second
grade includes those who are competent to act as assistants to
observers in the scientific or meteorological part of the work;
and the third (called Observer Sergeants) includes those who
have so complete a knowledge of the scientific principles
involved and of the use of the instruments employed as to
be fitted to take charge of Stations of Observation, and make
the constant and minute reports on which the conclusions of
the Central Office are based.</p>

<p>The Stations are from time to time inspected, and the whole
system kept in the most accurate order. Very much depends
on the intelligence and unremitting attention of the Observers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>This is, probably, the beginning of a work of the greatest
practical value to commerce and agriculture. It will continually
expand and grow more exact and useful, and from its relations
to the diffusion of important and useful knowledge we
have placed it with</p>

<h5>THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.</h5>

<p>1. Though there are no doubt many minor failures to meet
the wishes, and secure the interests of the people and some,
perhaps, that are really serious—though in these the people bear
a good share of the blame—the government has pursued an
enlightened policy in respect to the encouragement of Science,
and the diffusion of useful knowledge. What it can properly
do in the interest of the whole people has been done. The
Smithsonian Institution is not wholly a government establishment;
but the official machinery by which it was at first set
in motion, and is continued in operation, belongs to the government.
The funds with which it was founded, were furnished
by an individual, and he a foreigner. The history runs
thus: A noble-hearted Englishman, whose name was John
Smithson, residing in the city of London, bequeathed all his
property to the United States of America, for the purpose of
founding in Washington an establishment to be known as the
“Smithsonian Institution,” for the purpose of increasing and
diffusing knowledge among men. The United States accepted
the bequest, and in 1846 passed an act for the purpose of carrying
out the beneficent design of Mr. Smithson. This act
created “an establishment,” as it is denominated in the act, by
the name before stated. It might have been called a corporation,
for it has perpetual succession, and many of the powers
incident to a corporation.</p>

<p>2. By this act the President and Vice-President of the
United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the
Postmaster General, the Attorney General, and Chief Justice,
the Commissioner of the Patent Office, and the Mayor of
Washington—during the time they shall hold their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
offices, together with such other persons as they may elect
honorary members—were constituted the establishment under
the name of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p>3. It is located at Washington, and is managed by a board
of regents, composed of the Vice-President of the United
States, the Chief Justice of the United States, the Mayor of
Washington, three members of the Senate, and three members
of the House of Representatives; together with six other persons.
The board choose their own officers, and report their
proceedings to Congress at each session thereof.</p>

<p>4. In order to carry out Mr. Smithson’s noble design of
founding this institution, rooms have been prepared for the
reception of all objects of art, natural history, plants, and
geological and mineralogical specimens which now or hereafter
may belong to the United States, and such as may hereafter
be obtained. These are classified and arranged so as to
facilitate their examination and study. A vast collection has
already been obtained and deposited in the institution, and it
is constantly increasing by donations, by the researches and
industry of its professors, and by exchanges made with kindred
institutions at home and abroad. These are open to the
examination of the public, and offer an opportunity to students
and others to extend their scientific knowledge. This, together
with the reports of its professors, of experiments and new
discoveries, make it indeed an institution “for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.”</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LV">CHAPTER LV.<br />
<span class="smaller">REPORTS.</span></h4>

<p>1. Congress being the law-making power of the government,
it is evident that, to know precisely what laws it is
important to enact, to change, or to repeal, they should be kept
well informed of all that is done by government officials, and
the precise condition of every branch of the public service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
The President’s Messages are of the nature of reports made
by the Chief Executive to the legislative body for its information
and guidance. So it is enacted that the Secretaries of
State, Treasury, War, Navy, Interior, and Postmaster General,
together with the commissioners of the different bureaus, and
boards attached to these departments, shall annually report to
Congress. Heads of departments report directly to Congress.
So do many of the commissioners who are at the head of
bureaus. Boards report to the heads of departments to which
they are attached.</p>

<p>2. In this way Congress is kept advised of whatever is done
in every department, bureau, or board, to which any of the
public business is entrusted. These reports not only furnish
the law-making power with such information as it needs, but
serve as a check to any official misconduct. The annual
reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and Navy,
together with that of the Postmaster General, are State papers
which rank in importance next to the annual message of the
President. To them the people look for a detailed account of
the state and condition of those great departments over which
these Secretaries preside, and which so materially affect the
pecuniary and other great interests of the nation.</p>

<p>3. The foregoing remarks upon reports, throw light upon
the movements of the machinery by which the government is
operated, and show how officials are held responsible to the
superior power.</p>

<p>In this connection we may notice another kind of reports,
which come from another source. After each Congress has
convened and organized, the President of the Senate and the
Speaker of the House appoint what are denominated the standing
committees of each of these bodies.</p>

<p>When bills are presented to be passed into laws, or petitions
are sent in, they are always referred to the appropriate committee,
which examines them and reports to the body (of the
Senate or House) their conclusions upon the merits or demerits,
propriety or impropriety, of granting the petition, or of
passing the bill under consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>These reports generally govern the action of Congress when
they come to vote upon the passage of the law. But that is not
always the case; the body of either House may think differently
from its committee, and act contrary to its recommendations.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LVI">CHAPTER LVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">IMPEACHMENT.</span></h4>

<p>1. In the second article, section four, of the Constitution,
these words are found: “The President, Vice-President, and
all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from
office on impeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery,
or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”</p>

<p>2. Impeachment is a procedure against office holders only,
for the purpose of removing them from office. It inflicts no
other punishment; but the guilty party may afterwards be
prosecuted for his crime in a court of law, and punished in
such manner as the law directs.</p>

<p>3. The House of Representatives alone can present charges
looking to the trial of an officer of the government by impeachment.
Its action, in such a case, is similar to that of a Grand
Jury. It charges that the official has violated the law and
should be tried, in order, if guilty, to be removed from office.
It appoints a committee to conduct the prosecution before the
Senate, to which these charges are presented.</p>

<p>4. The Senate alone has the power to try the accused party.
When trying a case of impeachment it acts as a court, and
from its decision there is no appeal. The President cannot
pardon a criminal who has been impeached. When the President
of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court presides, but in no other case. No person can
be convicted in a trial of impeachment, unless two-thirds of
the Senate concur in finding the accused guilty of the alleged
offense.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="THE_JUDICIAL_DEPARTMENT">THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.</h3>

<p>This is the third Branch of the government, as determined
by the Constitution, and is of supreme importance and dignity.
Its sphere is to interpret the Constitution, to decide controversies,
to try offenders and to pronounce sentence on them,
to enforce rights, and to keep the whole organism of the
government in proper place and proportion. It is attached to
the governmental machinery as a Regulator. Without it the
other Departments must be the judges of the extent of their
own powers; the Constitution would be practically inoperative
to prevent inharmonious or mischievous legislation; and the
executive would possess the authority to try as well as punish
offenses.</p>

<p>The officers of this Department of the government are
expected to be men of much weight and dignity of character,
of wide legal culture, and are selected for, and continued in,
office under such circumstances as to guarantee, to a fair
extent, the requisite distinction and impartiality.</p>

<p>All this we shall see as we proceed to analyze its different
branches. These consist of the United States Supreme Court,
the Circuit Courts, the District Courts, and the Court of
Claims. The local courts in the District of Columbia, and
the Territorial Courts, though similar to the State Judiciaries,
are connected, by their relations to the General Government,
with this Department.</p>

<p>The importance of this branch of the government has become
more evident as time has passed, and the conflict of parties
has put the whole to test. The acrimonious party spirit of
our early post revolutionary history, which continued into
Monroe’s administration, was, in great part, the result of a
want of due confidence in, and respect for, the judiciary.
Experience showed that our people were law abiding, and that
the Legislative and Executive powers, equally with the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
were willing to submit to the official interpretation of the
Constitution, and all ready to join hands to maintain its
authority.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SUPREME COURT.</span></h4>

<p>1. This is the highest tribunal in the United States. If the
whole government be figuratively regarded as an arch this is
the “Key Stone of the Arch” without which the whole structure
would crumble and fall. In all cases of dispute as to the
meaning of the Constitution and the range of powers it confers,
or implies, it has sovereign power to decide; and from that
decision there is no appeal. Its declaration, as to the meaning
and application of the Constitution and the body of statutes
enacted under it, becomes the law of the land. It is the
great bulwark against tyrannical use of power, and conflicting
enactments, whether by National or State Legislatures.</p>

<p>2. This court has one Chief Justice and nine Associate
Justices, all appointed by the President, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate. They are appointed for life,
or during good behavior; they may be impeached for bribery
or other high crimes, and then removed from office. They
may also resign; but if they conduct themselves properly and
choose to retain their offices, there is no power by which they
can be removed, except the power of death. The Constitution
itself makes this provision, in order that the judges may be
removed as far as possible from the influence of party politics.
It is therefore expected that their decisions will not be biased
by party or political considerations; and it may not be amiss
to say that the provisions for keeping the judges of the United
States Courts in office for life, meets with almost universal
approbation; and has caused many to hope that the States
would alter their Constitutions and adopt the same plan;
believing it to be the surest way of preserving a pure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
independent Judiciary, on which depend the rights and liberties
of every citizen of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>3. This court holds but one term in a year, which commences
on the first Monday of December, and sits until it has
disposed of the business before it. Its sessions are always held
at Washington, the capital of the nation; there it has access
to the Congressional and Law Libraries, and to all the departments
and records of the government when necessary.</p>

<p>There is a class of causes which may be commenced in this
court. In these cases it has original jurisdiction. They are
such as affect ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls;
and those in which a State shall be a party. In other cases it
has only appellate jurisdiction. The greater part of its business
is to hear and determine appeals from inferior courts,
mainly from the United States Circuit Courts; and in some
instances from the highest State courts.</p>

<p>4. It has not only original, but exclusive jurisdiction in
causes where a State is a party, and when proceedings or suits
against ambassadors, or other public ministers or their servants,
are instituted. Its power to try appeals from lower courts,
called <i>appellate</i> jurisdiction, gives it the position of the highest
court in the nation.</p>

<p>It has power also to restrain or to prohibit proceedings in
the United States District Courts, when acting as courts of
Admiralty; or in cases of maritime jurisdiction. The judges
of this court hold the Circuit Courts, and allot themselves
among the judicial circuits.</p>

<p>The practice and rules of procedure in this court are very
similar to those of the Courts of Chancery and King’s Bench,
in England. Issues of fact are tried by jury, the same as in
other courts.</p>

<h5>OFFICERS OF THE COURT.</h5>

<p>5. The officers of this tribunal are the Judges, the Attorney
General, a clerk, a crier, and a reporter. The three last
named are appointed by the court. It is the duty of the Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
of the District of Columbia to attend this court, and to
serve process issuing from it.</p>

<p>An Attorney or Counsellor-at-Law, to be admitted to practice
in this court, must have been a practitioner in the Supreme
Court of the State where he lives.</p>

<p>6. The following are the names of all the Chief Justices
of the Supreme Court of the United States, from its establishment
to the present time; with the dates of their appointments,

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LVIII">CHAPTER LVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CIRCUIT COURTS.</span></h4>

<p>The next in dignity, power, and jurisdiction are the United
States Circuit Courts. While the Supreme Court is always
held in Washington, these are held in every State at such times
and places as special law of Congress directs. These are often
changed so as to accommodate both the people in the States
and the judges of the Court. As now arranged, the whole
Union is divided into nine circuits, each circuit comprising
several States, according to the size and population of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
States. The places are arranged with reference to convenience
of access by all the people in the circuit.</p>

<p>This Court is similar in design and authority to the Supreme
Court; indeed it is but a branch of it; the same officers presiding,
and the same class of questions being adjudicated by
it, viz.: those involving Constitutional Law; and this authority,
so important to uniformity of interpretation of constitutional
provisions, and to the enjoyment of rights guaranteed by that
instrument to citizens of all the States, is made pervading—is
carried within the reach of all.</p>

<p>2. The Circuit Courts are held by the Judges of the
Supreme Court, who allot the circuits among themselves, and
then travel each through his own circuit, until he has visited
and held a session in every State which lies within it. A Judge
of the Supreme Court is the presiding and supreme magistrate
in every Circuit Court, but the Judge of the District Court of
the district in which the Circuit is held, sits with the Judge of
the Supreme Court, as Associate Justice.</p>

<h5>JURISDICTION.</h5>

<p>3. These Courts have both original and appellate jurisdiction.
Causes may be appealed from the District Courts to the
Circuit. They also have concurrent jurisdiction with the State
courts, where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of $500,
and the United States are plaintiffs; or where an alien is a
party, or where the suit is between citizens of different States.
They have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases of crimes against
the United States, except where the law especially confers the
power on other courts. It extends to all cases under the revenue
laws of the United States.</p>

<p>4. There is also a certain class of cases (too tedious to be
described here in detail,) which may be removed from State
and from District Courts, into these courts, and be tried and
determined in the same manner as if they had been commenced
here.</p>

<p>The officers of Circuit Courts are, first, the Judges; second,
the District Attorney of the district in which the court is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
held; third, the Marshal of the district; and fourth, a Clerk,
who is appointed by the court.</p>

<p>5. It may be interesting, and perhaps useful to know how
the different circuits are formed, and what States lie in each.
They have been from time to time increased in number, as the
number of the States increased. In some cases States have
been at first placed in one circuit, and afterwards detached
and placed in another.</p>

<p>6. By the Acts of 1862 and 1863, the circuits were arranged
as follows:</p>

<p>First Circuit—Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine and New
Hampshire (by Act of 1820).</p>

<p>Second Circuit—Vermont, Connecticut, New York (Act of
1837).</p>

<p>Third Circuit—New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Fourth Circuit—Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and North
Carolina.</p>

<p>Fifth Circuit—South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi
and Florida.</p>

<p>Sixth Circuit—Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky and
Tennessee.</p>

<p>Seventh Circuit—Ohio and Indiana.</p>

<p>Eighth Circuit—Michigan and Illinois.</p>

<p>Ninth Circuit—Wisconsin, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Minnesota.</p>

<p>Tenth Circuit—California and Oregon.</p>

<p>But in 1866 this arrangement of the circuits was again
changed; and this was done, we suppose, to make the circuits
approximate nearer to the number of Associate Justices, as
reduced from nine to six by the same act; for, it was then
enacted that hereafter there should be no more Associate Justices
of the Supreme Court appointed, until they were reduced
(by death or resignation), to six.</p>

<p>7. The circuits by this last act were reduced to nine, and
were arranged as follows:</p>

<p>First and Second Circuits to remain as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>The Third was made up of the States of Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Delaware.</p>

<p>The Fourth, of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North
Carolina and South Carolina.</p>

<p>The Fifth, of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana
and Texas.</p>

<p>The Sixth, of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<p>The Seventh, of Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The Eighth, of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and
Arkansas.</p>

<p>The Ninth, of California, Oregon and Nevada.</p>

<p>We have inserted both of these circuit arrangements,
because one new State (Nebraska), has been admitted since the
act passed. Others will soon come in, and very probably the
old number of circuits and judges will be restored.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LIX">CHAPTER LIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">DISTRICT COURTS.</span></h4>

<p>1. We come now to the lowest grade of United States
courts, excepting the local courts in the District of Columbia,
and the Territorial Courts. A United States District Court is
held by a District Judge in every district. Every State constitutes
at least one district, several of the larger States are
divided into two, and some into three. There are at the present
time fifty-nine Judicial Districts, and consequently the
same number of District Judges, District Attorneys, District
Clerks and Marshals. The Judges, Attorneys and Marshals
are all appointed by the President and Senate; the Clerks by
the respective courts.</p>

<h5>TERMS.</h5>

<p>2. By the law of 1789 every District Judge was required to
hold four sessions a year, at such times and in such places as
Congress directed. This is done to this day in a great majority
of the States; but by later laws, in some of the districts
only two or three sessions a year are required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<h5>JURISDICTION.</h5>

<p>3. These courts have exclusive jurisdiction in all admiralty
and maritime causes. These relate to maritime contracts, and
to crimes against the laws of the United States, committed on
the sea and on navigable lakes and rivers. It embraces in this
country all contracts respecting vessels and navigation; such
as chartering, repairing, and fitting them out, seamen’s wages,
&amp;c. They have in some cases concurrent jurisdiction with the
Circuit Courts, as in cases of piracy, and exclusive cognizance of
cases where seizures are made for a violation of the revenue laws,
or laws relating to imports and navigation; and causes against
consuls and vice consuls where the amount claimed does not
exceed $100. In short, they have concurrent jurisdiction with
the Circuit Courts, of all crimes against the laws of the United
States, the punishment of which is not capital. The trial of
issues of fact in all causes except civil causes of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction, must be by jury.</p>

<p>4. Appeals are taken from these courts to the Circuit
Courts. The judges are appointed like those of the Supreme
Court, for life, or during good behavior, and receive various
amounts as salary, some more and some less, according to the
amount of services to be performed in their respective districts.</p>

<p>5. When vessels are captured in time of war, either by the
public armed vessels or by private armed ships, the facts and
circumstances of the capture must be brought before a United
States Circuit or District Court for adjudication; when the
vessel and cargo are either condemned as a prize, or restored to
their owners. When either of these courts adjudicate such
cases, it is called a Prize Court.</p>

<p>We give the number of Judicial Districts in each State
as they now exist, and the total number in all the States.
They are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alabama, 3.</li>
<li>Arkansas, 2.</li>
<li>California, 2.</li>
<li>Connecticut, 1.</li>
<li>Mississippi, 2.</li>

<li>Total, 59.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LX">CHAPTER LX.<br />
<span class="smaller">ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME JURISDICTION.</span></h4>

<p>In ancient times—and long before this government existed—civilized
and commercial nations had codes or laws which related
especially to transactions upon the sea. Those respecting ships
of war and warlike operations at sea were called the laws of
Admiralty; those respecting vessels engaged in commercial
affairs were called Maritime laws; and the courts empowered
with jurisdiction to hear and try causes, or to take any judicial
proceedings in those cases, were styled Courts of Admiralty
and Maritime Jurisdiction. These laws, in many respects,
differed so materially from the laws relating to affairs on land,
that the authority and power to take proceedings in and adjudicate
upon them was conferred upon a particular class of
courts. Hence we see the origin of the names of such tribunals.</p>

<p>In this country the United States District Courts have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
designated by the laws as the courts which shall have original
and exclusive authority to adjudicate this class of causes; yet
an appeal from the District to the Circuit Courts may be
taken.</p>

<h5>KIND OF CASES.</h5>

<p>The word Maritime designates that which relates to the sea.
Yet, in the United States, cases which come within Admiralty
and Maritime jurisdiction are not restricted to the sea, or to
transactions relating to business or crimes done on it, but are
made to embrace those which occur on navigable lakes and
rivers, and include seizures made for the violation of the laws
of impost, navigation, or trade, suits for the recovery of seamen’s
wages, contracts for building, repairing or fitting out
vessels, and, briefly, all contracts where the subject-matter
relates to the navigation of the sea. The District Courts have
Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction in all these cases, without
regard to the amount claimed, and in criminal as well as in
civil suits.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks show the workings of our judicial
system, as it applies to business done, and crimes committed
upon the high seas.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LXI">CHAPTER LXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">COURT OF CLAIMS.</span></h4>

<p>1. This court was established by act of Congress in 1855.
The law reads thus: “A court shall be established to be called
the Court of Claims, to consist of three judges, to be appointed
by the President and Senate, and to hold their offices during
good behavior; and the said court shall hear and determine all
claims founded upon any law of Congress, or upon any regulation
of an Executive department, or upon any contract express
or implied, with the government of the United States; which
may be suggested to it by a petition filed therein; and also all
claims which may be referred to said court by either house of
Congress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>2. On the third of March, 1863, the jurisdiction of this
court was enlarged, and two additional judges appointed
(making five), from the whole number of which the President
was authorized to appoint one a Chief Justice for said court.</p>

<p>3. The mode of commencing proceeding before this tribunal
is by petition; in which the claimant must fully set forth
his claim, how it arose, its amount, and the parties interested
therein. After the case has been heard and determined, the
court reports to Congress what its decision is, and if favorable
to the claimant, a bill is passed for his relief.</p>

<p>4. It holds one session a year, in Washington, commencing
on the first Monday in October, and continuing as long as the
business before it requires. It not only tries claims against the
government, but by its enlarged jurisdiction, conferred in 1863,
it also tries counter claims and set-offs which the United States
may have against the claimant. Appeals are taken from the
Court of Claims to the Supreme Court of the United States,
when the amount in controversy exceeds $3,000.</p>

<p>5. Before the establishment of this court, the only remedy
persons having claims upon the government had, was by petitioning
to Congress for relief; which experience proved to be
a long, tedious, and expensive mode of obtaining their dues.
The petition now goes to this court, where it is heard and adjudicated
in the same form, and by the same rules of procedure
which are observed in other courts; for Congress has conferred
upon it all the powers commonly possessed by other courts of
law. It also has a seal.</p>

<p>6. It has greatly facilitated the settlement of claims against
the government, and has relieved Congress of a great amount
of labor, which was urgently pressed upon it at every session.</p>

<p>7. In addition to the five judges, it has a Solicitor, an
Assistant Solicitor, and a Deputy Solicitor, all of whom are
appointed by the President and Senate; and are officers of the
court, whose duty it is faithfully to defend the United States
in all matters and claims before this court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>A bailiff, a clerk, a crier and messenger, all of whom are
appointed by the court, make up the remaining officials.</p>

<p>The claimants stand in the relation of plaintiffs, and the
government in that of defendant.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LXII">CHAPTER LXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.</span></h4>

<p>These officers are next in rank to the Judges of the Circuit
and District Courts with which their duties are connected.
Their relation to the government, in the class of cases that
come before those courts, is the same as that of the Attorney
General in the Supreme Court. They are its official legal counselors
in all cases involving the interests of the General Government
before the Circuit and District Courts in their several
districts. They are appointed in the same manner; that is,
nominated by the President, and confirmed by the Senate. It
is their duty “to prosecute in such district all delinquents for
crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the United
States, and all civil actions in which the United States shall be
concerned.” They are his clients, and he must enforce their
rights, and defend them, in the same manner that any attorney
protects and defends his client in any of the State courts. In
case of necessity, he may appoint a substitute to act in his
place. All fees over and above what he is allowed as compensation
for his services, he must report and pay into the United
States Treasury.</p>

<p>3. He must defend collectors of the customs and other
revenue officers in his district, when suits are brought against
them in their official capacity, and must report to the Solicitor
of the Treasury the number of suits determined and pending
in his district. And when prize cases have been determined,
or are pending in the District Court of his district, he must
report the state and condition of each case to the Secretary of
the Navy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>District Attorneys are appointed for four years, but may be
removed at the pleasure of the President. Their compensation
depends on the amount of business to be done in their respective
districts. When important ports of entry, such as New
York or Boston, lie in their districts, their duties are very
numerous, and they receive a corresponding compensation.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LXIII">CHAPTER LXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">UNITED STATES MARSHALS.</span></h4>

<p>1. United States Marshals are the ministerial officers of the
United States courts. Their duties and responsibilities are
very similar, and nearly identical with the duties and responsibilities
of sheriffs in the courts of the several States. They
are appointed by the President and Senate, for a term of four
years. They appoint their own deputies, and their compensation
consists of fees instead of a salary; and depends entirely
upon the amount of business they have to transact. There is
a Marshal in every Judicial District in the United States, and
there are fifty-nine of these districts in all. Every State forms
at least one district, while the larger States are divided into
two or three.</p>

<p>2. A District Court is held in every district; and it is the
Marshal’s duty to attend the sittings of these courts, and also
those of the United States Circuit Courts, when they happen
to sit in his district. The Marshal for the District of Columbia
must also attend the sittings of the Supreme Court, and
execute its precepts. We have said that they are the ministerial
officers of the United States courts; for it is their duty to
serve all writs and precepts emanating from them, whether of
a civil or criminal character; and to execute the judgments
and decrees of these tribunals; and for this purpose they are
authorized by law, (if necessary,) to command such assistance
as they may need in the execution of their duties. Before
they enter upon the duties of their office, they must be bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
to the United States for the faithful performance of them, and
must solemnly swear to do them, without malice or partiality;
and that they will take only lawful fees. They are also held
answerable for the delivery to their successors of all prisoners
who may be in their custody at the time of their removal, or
at the expiration of their term of office.</p>

<p>3. They also have the custody of all vessels and goods
seized by any officer of the revenue. It is their duty also to
summon, and to pay jurors and witnesses in behalf of any
prisoner to be tried for a capital offense, under the laws of the
United States. In the remarks made under the head “Census,”
we stated that it was made the duty of the Marshals to
superintend and direct the enumeration of the people; and to
collect such statistical facts as the law requires. This they do
through deputies, whom they appoint for that special purpose.</p>

<p>The United States Marshal is also required, on the first day
of January and July of each year, to make a return of all the
fees and emoluments of his office to the Secretary of the Interior;
and if they amount to more than $6,000 per year, he
must pay the surplus into the Treasury of the United States.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LXIV">CHAPTER LXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">GRAND JURY.</span></h4>

<p>1. By turning to the fifth article of the amendments to the
Constitution, you will find these words: “No person shall be
held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless
on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury; except in
cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when
in actual service, in time of war or public danger.” This constitutional
provision makes a Grand Jury a very important
agent or instrumentality in the execution of the laws, and also
a safeguard of the liberties and rights of the people. It
secures every person from the expense and disgrace of a trial
for infamous crimes, unless a Grand Jury of his countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
shall find upon inquiry and investigation, that there are good
reasons for believing that the person so charged has committed
the alleged offense.</p>

<p>2. This provision not only protects those who are charged
with these crimes against the laws of the United States, but
those also who may be charged with such offenses against the
laws of any State; for no State can arrest and try any person
for a capital or infamous crime without these preliminary proceedings
of a Grand Jury; and should it do so, the United
States Supreme Court would set its laws aside, as contrary to
the Constitution of the United States. Here we see that the
government is just as careful to protect its citizens from injustice
by hasty judicial proceedings as it is to punish them after
a fair and impartial trial.</p>

<p>3. A Grand Jury, when called to take cognizance of violations
of the laws of the United States, to find indictments
against those who are charged with them, is summoned by a
judge of a United States court in the circuit or district where
the alleged crime has been perpetrated; and it must take notice
of all crimes against the laws of the United States, which may
be brought to its knowledge, within the circuit or district in
which it sits. Hence, if ordered by a Circuit Judge, its powers
extend over all those States which lie in that circuit. But
when ordered by a District Judge, its powers extend only to
that district in which it sits, and a district never embraces
more than one State, and in many cases a State is divided into
two or three districts.</p>

<p>4. This shows us how much more extensive is the jurisdiction
of a Grand Jury, when acting under the laws of the
United States, than when acting under State laws. In the
former it extends generally all over a State, and sometimes
over several States. But in the latter it is confined to the
county in which it sits.</p>

<h5>GRAND AND PETIT JURIES.</h5>

<p>A Grand Jury never acts but in criminal cases. A Petit
Jury acts in both criminal and civil cases. The finding or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
conclusion arrived at by a Grand Jury is called a presentment,
or an indictment. The finding of a Petit Jury is called its
verdict.</p>

<p>5. Second, a Grand Jury sits alone (not in the presence of
the court), and deliberates upon such matters of a criminal
character as it possesses knowledge of, or which may be
brought to its notice by the court or by other persons; and
when it finds that great evils exist, and wrongs have been
perpetrated, it presents them to the court, and calls the attention
of the law officers to them; which is equivalent to a
recommendation that judicial proceedings should be commenced
to abate the evil, or to punish the wrong-doer. This
is called a presentment of the Grand Jury.</p>

<p>And when they find, upon such evidence as they have, that
a great crime has been perpetrated, or that they have good
reason so to believe, and that it has been perpetrated by some
person specified, they report their finding or conclusion to the
Court. This is called an indictment by the Grand Jury; after
which the person so charged is arrested, if at large, and can
be found, and is either imprisoned or held to bail for his
appearance at court to stand trial.</p>

<p>6. A Grand Jury never tries a case. It only says to the
court by its presentment or indictment, that the case presented,
or the person indicted, ought to be brought before the
court, and tried for the alleged wrong or crime.</p>

<p>A Petit Jury sits with the court, hears the pleadings and
arguments of counsel on both sides, listens to the evidence
of witnesses; and then hears the charge of the judge, as to
the law applicable to the case; after which they withdraw and
deliberate alone upon the case, and if they agree in a criminal
case, their verdict is “Guilty,” or “Not Guilty;” if in a
civil suit, they say how much one party is indebted (if any),
to the other.</p>

<p>7. The object aimed at in that article of the Constitution
which stands at the head of this chapter, is to protect persons
from false charges of crime, and hasty adjudication of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
charges; for it substantially amounts to a declaration that no
person shall be punished for a capital or infamous crime, unless
one jury, before trial, shall, upon information and belief, charge
him with the offense; and another, after trial, shall find him
guilty of the alleged crime.</p>

<p>The above remarks are as applicable to Grand and Petit
Juries, acting under State, as those which act under the United
States laws.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LXV">CHAPTER LXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.</span></h4>

<p>1. The Supreme power in the United States is lodged in
the general government, with its three branches: Legislative,
Executive, and Judicial. The authority of this government,
however, is restricted to the powers expressly conferred on it
by the Constitution; all other power being reserved to the
States, or the people. The States also are sovereign in their
own limits, over all questions not expressly assigned to the
General Government. Instead of conflict of authority there
is true harmony. The people elect the members of both the
classes of legislators and executives, and both are equally
employed in attending to the interests of the people confided
to their care; the first to General, the second to Local interests.
All the members and officers of each are the servants of the
Sovereign People.</p>

<p>2. As soon as the general government was organized under
the Constitution, there arose two parties. One wished to render
the General Government prominent in order to secure concentration
of strength and vigor of action; the other desired
to exalt the State governments in the fear that the general
government might prove ambitious of too much power, and
disregard the welfare of the people. As in almost all party
platforms, both these seemed to take too narrow a view. Washington
was held to sympathize more with the first, Jefferson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
was the acknowledged leader of the second. Together they
secured a very fair mingling of both these principles in the
administration and general policy of the country. A strict
adherence to the meaning and spirit of the Constitution would
not seem to give special favor to either, or allow a conflict of
interests.</p>

<p>3. The Supreme Court, or the Judiciary, is the regulating,
or reconciling element, which the Constitution set over the
whole to see that no undue or improper action should defeat
its purposes, and that no collisions of authority should occur.
Its decision is final, it being the last resort in cases of appeal;
and, as the only final and authoritative interpreter of Constitutional
Law, it may revise the action of all other branches of
both general and local government, and put them in harmony.</p>

<p>4. It is plain that the authors of the Constitution intended
to fuse the separate elements, or States, into one whole, where
general matters were concerned; and to leave those elements
perfectly free and absolute control of all questions involving
only their separate and local concerns. The <i>People</i>, and their
welfare, are the aim and end of both organizations. The possession
of power for ambitious ends by general, State, or municipal
organizations, or by individuals, was apparently as foreign
to the thought of the whole Constitutional convention of 1787
as it seems always to have been to the mind of Washington.
That great man was the leader of clear-sighted and pure-minded
statesmen, and whatever weaknesses and faults have existed at
any time (and there have always been an abundance of them,
as there were in the times of Washington) among political
leaders, it must be allowed that the Fathers had worthy sons
who knew how to work correctly the problems left them by
their predecessors. A single question proved quite unmanageable
to the sons, as it had before to the fathers, and had to be
settled by an appeal to arms; but it demonstrated the strength
of the people and the ability of our institutions to withstand
the severest shocks.</p>

<p>5. The original States adopted the Constitution after deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
study, and all the States since admitted virtually do the
same. Their general structure in their legislative, executive,
and judicial arrangements is substantially the same as that of
the General Government. The State Legislatures consist of
two Houses, chosen in different ways, and for different terms;
the relations between them being similar to those of Congress.
Every State has a governor, answering to the President of the
United States, who is the executive officer of the State government.
The courts in all are organized on the same principle
as the Supreme Court of the general government. Although
there are small variations from the model, in various States,
they do not affect the general resemblance; and, due allowance
being made for the different subjects to be treated, the
analysis of the general, or of any of State governments, will
give a sufficiently correct view of all.</p>

<p>6. A State cannot make treaties with a foreign power, nor
declare war against it. It cannot raise a revenue by duties on
imports, nor control the postal service, or matters involving
the interests of other States. It has therefore no Department
for Foreign relations, its Secretary of State dealing only with
State affairs. It has no Department of War, or Navy, and no
Postmaster General. The Governor’s signature is necessary
to the validity of laws passed by the two branches of the legislature,
and in most of the States he has a veto power similar
to that of the President. He has an executive council answering
to the Cabinet. The courts are more numerous than those
of the general government, to meet the wants of all classes of
the people; ranging from a Supreme or Constitutional court,
whose office it is to interpret and apply the constitution of the
State; through all grades, of Common Pleas, Circuit, District,
Police, and Recorder’s courts down to neighborhood courts
held by Justices of the Peace, or Aldermen. There are various
others in different States for special purposes.</p>

<p>7. States are subdivided for purposes of local government
into counties and towns; and these into smaller portions for
educational and other purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the whole is like an extensive system of machinery,
wheel being fitted to wheel. From the lowest to the highest
the people of each local division have entire control over the
subjects in which they only are interested; and there is very
little opportunity for the exercise of arbitrary power. Executive
officers may be changed by election, or impeachment, if
they do not give satisfaction, or prove unfaithful; and as many
securities as it is possible to devise are provided against abuses,
or, if a majority in any State (or the United States) believe
that an improvement can be made, there are constitutional and
legal methods for securing it.</p>

<p>Thus our country is insured against serious discontents for
which no remedy is at hand; and from the revolutions and
internal disturbances that interrupt the progress, and destroy
the resources of so many other countries. It is a government
<i>of</i>, <i>for</i>, and <i>by</i> the people. The value of any institution or
office in the United States, from the school district and director
to State legislature, Congress, governor, or President, is determined
by the relation it bears to the Public Welfare; and when
it ceases to be useful there are, as there ought to be, legal means
for laying it aside.</p>

<span class="smaller">INDIVIDUAL STATES.</span></h4>

<p>The original thirteen States are here arranged in the order
of size—the one having the largest area being placed first.
They are ranked according to their <i>present</i> area, the claims of
some of them at first extending to territory since erected into
States; and one, Virginia, has been divided. Her former area
would have ranked her as first.</p>

<p>The States that follow are placed in the order of their admission
into the Union.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="500px;">
<img src="images/state-ga.jpg" width="500" height="235" alt="Illustration of Georgia state seal" />
</div>

<h5>GEORGIA.</h5>

<p>This State was the last settled of the original thirteen. It
was founded in the benevolent anxiety of Gen. James Oglethorpe
and others to relieve the distresses of the poor in
England. Those imprisoned for debt were sent out in large
numbers. With this object was connected the desire to prevent
the extension of the Spanish settlements in Florida, and the
English government favored the undertaking. This class of
settlers proving indolent and improvident, a better was attracted
by laying off many towns, in the best locations, and offering
fifty acres free to every actual settler. Many Scotch and German
emigrants improved this opportunity, to the great advantage
of the colony.</p>

<p>Gen. Oglethorpe imitated the wise conduct of Penn, in his
treaties with the Indians.</p>

<p>He commenced his settlement at Savannah, in 1733, cheerfully
assisted by the South Carolinians, who were pleased to
see a barrier placed between them and the Spaniards. Oglethorpe
had several conflicts with them, and succeeded in
protecting his colony. The introduction of slaves was at first
forbidden; but, as the colony seemed to fall behind the neighboring
provinces for want of laborers, the restriction was
removed. In 1752 the company gave up their charter, and
Georgia became a royal province. It took part with the other
colonies in resistance to the aggressions of the English ministry,
at the Revolutionary period, and its condition during the
war was similar to that of North and South Carolina. Being
new, and on the frontier, it was not conspicuous.</p>

<p>The northern part of the State is uneven, the central and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
lower sections productive under a wise and careful culture, but
easily exhausted under bad management. She has long navigable
rivers, and her manufacturing and commercial capabilities
are excellent. The system of slave-labor and the misfortunes
of the Civil War have embarrassed her progress, but the energy
of her people is fast raising her to her proper rank as a flourishing
State.</p>

<p>Georgia has an area of 52,009 square miles, equal to
33,285,760 acres. She was named after George II.</p>

<p>The population in 1870 was 1,200,000, which entitles her to
nine Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>The State lies in the fifth judicial circuit, and has two judicial
districts; also four ports of entry—Savannah, Brunswick, St.
Mary’s, and Hardwicke; and two ports of delivery—Augusta
and Sunbury.</p>

<p>The capital is Atlanta. The State election is held on the
first Tuesday in August. The Legislature meets on the second
Wednesday in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of her laws is: “Be it enacted by the
Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia
in General Assembly met; and it is hereby enacted by the
authority of the same.”</p>

<h5>NORTH CAROLINA.</h5>

<p>A Florentine navigator, sent out by Francis I., King of
France, first published an account of this region. He visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
it in 1524. Ribault, a French protestant, sent out with a
colony by Admiral Coligni, in 1564, named the southern coast
Carolina, from Charles IX. (in Latin Carolus), King of France.
The colony was not permanent. In 1585 Sir Walter Raleigh
made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a colony on Roanoke
Island. Some fifty years later the colonists of Virginia made
a settlement in the limits of this State, called Albemarle.
This territory was patented to a company of noblemen. The
first colony, founded before this patent was issued, and enjoying
entire liberty, became an asylum from the religious intolerance,
almost universal at that time. In 1666 they numbered
800.</p>

<p>Many French Huguenots, attracted by this freedom and the
mild climate and extreme fertility of the soil, settled here and
added greatly to the industrious and virtuous elements of the
population. The revolutionary struggle was singularly bitter
and bloody in this State and South Carolina, from the number
and sanguinary character of the royalists and tories, and from
the partisan or guerrilla mode of warfare adopted.</p>

<p>The majority were, however, determined and valiant patriots,
and rendered it impossible for the British to establish a firm
control over this part of the country.</p>

<p>The eastern surface is low, the western mountainous, and
much of the midland is covered with pine forests which produce
large quantities of turpentine. The soil is favorable to
agriculture. Yams, rice, and cotton, in addition to the cereals,
are raised with success. The fisheries in Albemarle Sound are
an important source of wealth. A large number of minerals
are found in the State. Like most of the Southern States, its
resources have been but partially developed.</p>

<p>This is one of the original thirteen States, and has an
area of 50,704 square miles, equal to 32,450,560 acres, with a
population of 1,069,614 (one-third colored), and entitled to
eight members of Congress. North Carolina, by act of 1866,
was located in the fourth judicial circuit, which is composed
of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
South Carolina; and is divided into three judicial districts,
called the districts of Albemarle, Pamlico, and Cape Fear.
The collection districts, and the ports of entry and delivery in
this State have been so often modified and discontinued that
there is some uncertainty as to the number. There are, as
near as we can determine, ten districts, ten ports of entry, and
nine ports of delivery.</p>

<p>Raleigh is the capital. There the Legislature meets biennially
on the first Monday in November. The State election
is held on the first Thursday in August.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted
by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina, and
it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same.”</p>

<h5>NEW YORK.</h5>

<p>The “Empire State” is very fortunately situated for the
promotion of all the interests that form the basis of prosperity
of a Nation. It contains the commercial metropolis of the
country, which is connected, by its great navigable river, the
Hudson, and the Erie canal, with the fertile interior and the
commerce of the chain of great lakes in the west; while Lakes
Ontario and Champlain furnish the means of profitable trade
with Canada on the north. As its natural commercial facilities
are unrivaled, so also, every auxiliary that can be furnished
by art is employed to develop its resources and to attract trade
and manufactures.</p>

<p>Its river was discovered by the celebrated navigator, Captain
Henry Hudson, in 1609, and he gave it his name. He was
employed, at this time by the Dutch, who claimed and settled
the territory in the following year. They established posts on
Manhattan Island, where New York now stands, and at Albany—calling
the country in general, New Netherlands. They held
it until 1644; laying claim, also, to Connecticut and New Jersey.
Their rule was despotic, and when the Duke of York,
afterward James II., King of England, sent a squadron to
enforce English claims to it, the inhabitants declined to resist,
and it became an English colony without a struggle. The city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
and colony received the name of New York and continued
henceforth in English hands. Its position favored a steady-growth
in population and wealth; and it took an active part in
the Revolution. Its central position made it the pivot of the
war, the leading struggles taking place in or near it. New
York city was held by the British during most of the war, but
the skillful strategy and watchfulness of Washington, and the
valor of his officers and troops preserved the river in American
hands throughout. It ratified the Constitution July 26th,
1788, and soon outstripped every State in all things, except
education, no State being able to compare with Massachusetts
in that respect.</p>

<p>New York is the largest and richest city in the Union. The
State abounds in salt and mineral springs, and its central and
western parts are unexcelled for agriculture; while the eastern,
more mountainous, but nearer to markets, and more abundant
in water power, is equally favorable to grazing and manufactures.</p>

<p>Its area is 47,000 square miles, equal to 30,080,000 acres.
The population in 1870 was larger than that of any other State,
being officially stated at 4,364,411. It has thirty-three Members
of Congress.</p>

<p>It forms part of the second judicial circuit, and has three
judicial districts; eleven ports of entry, and fourteen ports of
delivery, with the privilege of eight or nine others if the President
of the United States deems them necessary.</p>

<p>The Capital is Albany. The State elections are held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and the Legislature
meets on the first Tuesday in January in each year. The
style of the enacting clause is: “Be it enacted by the people
of the State of New York represented in Senate and Assembly.”</p>

</div>

<h5>PENNSYLVANIA.</h5>

<p>“The Keystone State” has been eminently fortunate in three
various ways. Its founder, William Penn, happily united
benevolence and high political wisdom, with a thrifty and prudent
economy, and possessed sufficient influence and tact to
infuse his colony with his own qualities to a large degree, and
the advantages acquired in the beginning, have shed their
favoring influence on all its future, to the present time.</p>

<p>Penn, as proprietor of his province, had almost kingly
power; yet, as a law-giver, he acknowledged the liberties of
the people, and accustomed them to many of the forms of self-government
afterward incorporated into the Constitution of the
United States. His just and conciliatory conduct toward the
Indians, and the exemption of Pennsylvania from barbarous
Indian wars, in consequence, proves the utility of the practice
of unvarying justice and kindness toward them; and stands in
strong and significant contrast with the opposite course, so
often pursued, and with results so distressing.</p>

<p>A colony was established by Penn in the southeastern part
of the State, in the year 1682. The government was conducted
by a governor, a council of three, and a House of Delegates,
chosen by the people. The largest religious liberty was allowed,
and punishment of crime was mitigated from the severity, customary
in those times, to something like the mildness now
practiced among us.</p>

<p>The colony enjoyed seventy years of enlightened government,
and prospered greatly. A large immigration of hardy and
thrifty Germans and Swedes spread over the State and supplied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
in Revolutionary times, the “fighting material” which the
religious principles of the Quakers forbade them to furnish.</p>

<p>The second eminent advantage of the State, was in its central
position, the facilities furnished to commerce and trade by
the Delaware river on its eastern boundary, and the Ohio, on
the west, connecting it with the valley of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The third superiority, later in development in some of its
features, relates to its wealth of resources. Lying midway
between north and south, its climate is temperate and mild.
Its soil on the eastern border and along the valleys of its
numerous rivers is of great fertility; while its inexhaustible
coal deposits are far more valuable in promoting the steady
growth of her citizens in wealth than mines of gold. Iron,
copper, zinc, marble and slate are, apparently, inexhaustible.
Her railroads and canals furnish a suitable means for the development
of these resources, and the transportation for all her
valuable commodities to profitable markets, and prove her later
citizens to have inherited the economic wisdom and thrift of
the founder of their State.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania valiantly bore the share in the struggles and
sacrifices of the Revolution to which her position, her wealth
and numbers, called her. Philadelphia—“The City of Brotherly
Love” (the name means this,) was the first capital of the
Republic. It was there that the Declaration of Independence
was originated and signed.</p>

<p>Its area is 46,000 square miles, equal to 29,440,000 acres.
The population in 1870 was 3,515,993, entitling her to twenty-seven
Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>It is in the third judicial circuit; and forms two judicial
districts. There are two ports of entry, and two collection
districts. Harrisburg is the capital; the Legislature assembling

<h5>VIRGINIA.</h5>

<p>“The Old Dominion,” as this State has been called, in
familiar style, has certain high claims to such a distinctive
appellation. It was the colony in which the first permanent
settlement was made, and for fourteen years before the perils
of the wilderness were encountered by the Puritan Fathers of
New England, it confronted famine and Indian hostility. Its
people were quite different in character from those of most of
the other colonies. While many were from the lowest classes,
a goodly number of the gentry and nobility of England were
transplanted to this colony. Some were men of wealth, character
and influence; and the hereditary value of that element
became conspicuous when revolutionary times came, and the
colonial government, which had been from the first, kept
closely dependent on the royal will, being set aside, permitted
to this class a free field of action. None were more eloquent,
more zealous, more valiant or wise, during the “time that tried
men’s souls.” The talents, patriotism, and wisdom of Washington,
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and many others almost
equally useful, attest the quality of the Virginian stock of
patriots, and shed honor on their native State.</p>

<p>It was settled in 1607, at Jamestown. The infant colony
was long exposed to danger of destruction by Indian hostility;
but, favored by circumstances, grew up to strength, and became
a protection to others. An almost constant struggle was maintained
with the royal governors, who were disposed to encroach
on their liberties. Notwithstanding the number of decayed
and worthless <i>gentlemen</i>, and the dregs of the English populace,
who entered as components into her population, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
whole, they proved worthy of the republic they so largely
helped to rear. Their best blood was spilled in its cause, and
their material support was never withheld in time of need.</p>

<p>This State is much varied in surface. In the southeast it is
low and level; in the west and northwest mountainous, with
numerous large streams and fertile vallies, and a charming
climate. Its mineral wealth of coal, iron and salt is very
great; its water power for manufacturing purposes unsurpassed;
and its commercial position everything to be desired.
None of these advantages have been more than partially
improved; and the future of the State is destined to be exceedingly
brilliant. Old and nourishing colleges testify to the
interest taken in education; and railroads and other means of
internal development have already prepared the way for its
greatness. She exports tobacco, flour, oysters, and cotton, and
her agricultural wealth is constantly improving.</p>

<p>Virginia is also one of the original thirteen States, and had
an area previous to the division in 1862, of 61,352 square
miles, equal to 39,265,280 acres; but after West Virginia was
set off as a separate State, there were but 38,352 square miles
left of this once great State, equal to 24,545,280 acres.</p>

<p>The population in 1860 amounted to 1,596,318, which entitles
the State to nine Members of Congress. By the division
the number of Representatives was cut down to nine; the
new State receiving three out of the twelve. Population in
1870, 1,224,830.</p>

<p>Virginia lies in the fourth judicial circuit, which by the act
of 1866, was composed of this State, Maryland, West Virginia,
and North Carolina and South Carolina. There were
two judicial districts in this State, anterior to the division; the
Eastern and the Western. There is now but one.</p>

<p>There were also twelve collection districts in this State, and
twelve ports of entry, all of which remain the same as they
were before West Virginia was cut off, for they were all located
on the Atlantic coast, or on the bays and rivers running into
the Atlantic Ocean; there are also ten ports of delivery.</p>

<p>Richmond is the capital. The State election is held on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The Legislature
meets on the first Monday in December.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws of Virginia is: “Be it
enacted by the General Assembly.”</p>

</div>

<h5>SOUTH CAROLINA.</h5>

<p>The first permanent settlement in this State was made in
1670, at Port Royal, where the French Huguenots had failed
three-quarters of a century before. The noble company who
had received a charter for the settlement and government of
the Carolinas employed the celebrated philosopher, John
Locke, to draw up a philosophical plan of government, which
they attempted to carry into effect to the great annoyance of
the colonists. It proved impracticable, and was finally abandoned.</p>

<p>The French introduced the culture of the vine with success,
and rice was brought at an early day from Madagascar, the
cultivation of which became extensive.</p>

<p>Many vexations were endured by the colonists by the injudicious
management of the proprietary government, and at
length they, by petition, obtained a revocation of the charter,
receiving, in 1720, a governor appointed by the crown. They
endured for many years all the horrors of warfare with the
Tuscarora Indians, whom they finally defeated and expelled.
Rutledge, Sumpter, and Marion were distinguished leaders of
the patriots during the occupation of the State by the British
forces; employing with success a partisan warfare, and defying
the efforts of a superior British force to hold the State in
subjection.</p>

<p>The climate has been likened to that of Italy, and the products
of the north and of the tropics are equally cultivated.
The State abounds in agricultural and manufacturing resources,
and has a fine commercial position.</p>

<p>South Carolina is one of the original thirteen States, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
has an area of 29,385 square miles, making 18,806,400 acres,
with a population, in 1870, of 728,000, (over half colored,)
which gives her five Members of Congress.</p>

<p>By an act of 1866, South Carolina was located in the fourth
judicial circuit; it is divided into two judicial districts, called
the Eastern and Western.</p>

<p>There are three collection districts in this State, and four
ports of entry, to-wit: Georgetown, Charleston, Beaufort and
Port Royal; but no ports of delivery.</p>

<p>The capital is Columbia. The State elections are held on
the fourth Monday in November. The Legislature meets on
the third Wednesday in October.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted
by the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives,
now met and sitting in General Assembly, and by authority
of the same.”</p>

<h5>MARYLAND.</h5>

<p>This territory at first was included in the patent to the Virginia
colony; but was, in 1632, re-patented to Lord Baltimore,
an English nobleman, who had embraced the catholic faith,
and sought, in the American wilderness, an asylum where he
and his co-religionists might enjoy the freedom from persecution
denied them in England. It was called Maryland from
the queen of Charles I., King of England. A part of this
patent was covered by that subsequently made to William
Penn, and produced much trouble between the descendants of
these men, and their respective colonies. A settlement was
commenced, mainly by catholic gentlemen, in 1634, and called
St. Mary’s, on a branch of the Potomac.</p>

<p>The wise liberality that distinguished the settlement of Pennsylvania
marked all the earlier history of Maryland. They
cultivated friendly relations with the natives and with their
neighbors. Lord Baltimore was liberal in his expenditures for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
the growing colony, and gave them a liberal government.
When the civil war commenced in England, resulting in the
death of Charles I. and the rise of Cromwell to power, the
first troubles of the colonists of Maryland began, and continued
until 1716, when the heirs of the original proprietor resumed
their rights and maintained them until the Revolution.</p>

<p>This State was one of the original thirteen, and gave a hearty
support to the patriot side during the war for freedom.</p>

<p>The surface of the country is, in great part, low and sandy;
the climate agreeable and the soil favorable to agricultural
pursuits. Her commercial position is excellent, being situated
on either side of Chesapeake bay and bounded by the Potomac
river on the west. The District of Columbia, containing the
National Capital, was located on the last named river within
her limits.</p>

<p>Maryland has an area of 11,124 square miles—equal to
7,119,360 acres. The population in 1870 was 780,806, which
gives her six Representatives in Congress. By an act of Congress,
passed in 1866, this State was put in the fourth judicial
circuit, which is composed of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia,
North and South Carolina. Maryland constitutes one
judicial district; has ten ports of entry, viz.: Baltimore, Chester,
Oxford, Vienna, Snow-Hill, Annapolis, Nottingham, St.
Mary’s, Georgetown, and Havre de Grace; and twelve ports
of delivery.</p>

<p>Annapolis is the capital. The State election is held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The Legislature
meets on the first Wednesday in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted
by the General Assembly of Maryland.”</p>

<h5>NEW HAMPSHIRE.</h5>

<p>This State is often called “The Old Granite State,” as well
from its mountainous character as the resolute spirit of its
inhabitants. It is small, having an area of only 9,280 square
miles, which make 5,939,200 acres. Its population in 1870 was
318,300, entitling it to three Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>The first settlement was founded at Dover, in 1624, by the
English. It suffered much from Indian wars, and its growth
was slow. It was made a separate province in 1680, having
previously been under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. It
was one of the original thirteen States, and took an active and
vigorous part in the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>Its soil is light and unfavorable to agriculture, but furnishes
good pasturage and produces fine cattle. It contains the White
Mountains, the highest in New England. Its streams are
utilized for manufacturing purposes. Quarries of marble and
granite abound. Minerals, and precious stones of several varieties
are found in various parts of the State. The hardy and
enterprising sons to whom it has given birth are to be found
in every State in the Union.</p>

<p>It lies in the first judicial circuit; constitutes one judicial
district; and is embraced in one collection district, and therefore
has but one port of entry. There are three ports of
delivery.</p>

<p>The capital is Concord. The Legislature assembles on the
first Monday in June, the State election being held the second
Tuesday in March.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws runs thus: “Be it enacted
by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly
convened.”</p>

<h5>NEW JERSEY.</h5>

<p>This State was first settled at Bergen by the Swedes sent
over by the Christian hero-king, Gustavus Adolphus, in the
year 1638. They, however, soon fell under the control of the
Dutch, who claimed the territory. The next settlement was
made at Elizabethtown, from Long Island, in 1664. New
Jersey came into the hands of the English along with New
Netherlands, but soon became an independent province; Philip
Carteret becoming its first governor, in 1665. It was for some
time under the control of the celebrated Quaker, William Penn,
received a liberal form of government, and, not suffering from
the Indians enjoyed prosperity for many years. Afterwards
it passed through various vicissitudes in its government, was
for a time joined to New York, but recovered its independent
existence in 1738; and was one of the original thirteen States,
taking a very prominent part in the Revolution. Its territory,
lying between New York and Philadelphia, was the field on
which the hostile armies fought and manouvered, for some
years. It ratified the Constitution unanimously, December
18th, 1787. It has been rewarded for its patriotism and devotion
to liberty by unbroken prosperity. Its manufactures are
in a flourishing state. Its vicinity to the great commercial
centres of the Atlantic coast; the mildness of its climate, and
the adaptation of its soil to the growth of fruit and vegetables
have made it the Garden State of the Union. Its agricultural
wealth is much increased by its abundant beds of marl and
peat. The extreme north is hilly and the extreme south low
and sandy. Education receives much attention.</p>

<p>It has an area of 8,320 square miles, or 5,324,800 acres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
The population, by the census of 1870, was 905,794, which
gives her seven Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>This State lies in the third judicial circuit, and forms one
judicial district. There are six ports of entry, and as many
collection districts; and also eight ports of delivery.</p>

<p>Its capital is Trenton. The State election is held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and the Legislature
assembles the second Tuesday in January.</p>

<p>The form of the enacting clause is as follows: “Be it
enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of
New Jersey.”</p>

<h5>MASSACHUSETTS.</h5>

<p>The “Bay State,” so named from the deep encroachments
of the sea on her eastern border, was settled in 1620, at Plymouth,
by English Puritans; a class of sternly pious men, who
abandoned England to find freedom of worship in the savage
wilds of America. They were men of great resolution and
intelligence, and succeeded in imbuing the new colony with a
fair degree of their own virtue. They suffered much, at first,
from deprivation of the comforts they had left in England, and
from the hostility of the Indians. They were too much in
earnest to be tolerant, and persecutions of pretended witches,
of Quakers and Baptists, have given them an unenviable
notoriety.</p>

<p>This State was a leading one among the original thirteen,
and the first to take up arms and to be invaded by the British
forces at the commencement of the War of the Revolution.
Her influence on the national character has been great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>This State is the first in the Union for cotton and woolen manufactures,
its cotton mills alone employing about twenty-five
thousand hands. In extent of all its manufactures it is third
in the Union. The soil is sterile in great part, but the energy
of the people finds abundant other sources of wealth. Commerce
and fisheries receive much attention, and produce much
wealth.</p>

<p>Education is carefully attended to, and its public school system
a model for other States. She has an area of 7,800
square miles. Her population in 1870 was 1,457,351, and
entitles her to eleven Members of Congress. It is in the first
judicial circuit, and forms one judicial district. There are
fourteen ports of entry, and twenty-five ports of delivery in
this State.</p>

<p>Boston is the Capital, the metropolis of New England, and
an important center of intellectual and business energy. The
Legislature meets on the first Wednesday in January, and the
State elections are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday
in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause is: “Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives, in General Court assembled, and by
the authority of the same, as follows:”</p>

<h5>CONNECTICUT.</h5>

<p>This State takes its name from its principal river, which,
entering from the north, runs through the State nearly in the
center. It was settled in 1633 from Massachusetts, the fertility
of the valley of the Connecticut attracting them to brave
the perils of conflict with the Indians, and with the Dutch,
settled where New York now stands, who laid claim to it.
The Dutch withdrew, the Indians were subdued in many bloody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
battles, and a Puritan State—exceeding, if possible, the religious
strictness of the Massachusetts colony, and not behind her
in energy, in virtue, in attention to education, and love of liberty—soon
grew up to wealth and prosperity.</p>

<p>A decisive battle in 1636, on the Mystic river, annihilated
the Pequod Indians.</p>

<p>Connecticut, in 1700, followed the example set by Massachusetts
in 1638, by founding Yale college, which, to this day,
very fairly rivals Harvard in the former State. Both have
contributed largely to the intelligence and culture of the American
people. It took a leading part in the Revolution; ratified
the constitution June 9th, 1788; and has displayed the zeal
in promoting the public good that has been so prominent in
the cultivation of her educational and material interests.</p>

<p>The surface of the State is uneven and rocky. Manufactures
and commerce are the leading interests, although agriculture is
not neglected. It is rich in minerals. Gold, silver, lead, iron,
copper and bismuth are found, while marble, of fine quality,
and granite abound.</p>

<p>Its area is small, embracing only 4,674 square miles, or
2,991,360 acres. It has four representatives in Congress. The
population in 1870 was 537,418. It is part of the second judicial
circuit, and constitutes one judicial district. She has five
ports of entry, and five collection districts, with twenty-two
ports of delivery.</p>

<p>It has had two capitals ever since the first two colonies,
established at Hartford and New Haven, were united; and
holds her State election on the first Monday in April. The
Legislature meets the first Wednesday in May.</p>

<p>The enacting clause runs thus: “Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives in General Assembly convened.”</p>

<h5>DELAWARE.</h5>

<p>The first settlement of Delaware was made by the Swedes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
in pursuance of the policy of the valiant Gustavus Adolphus,
king of Sweden. European wars, in which he was engaged,
and in which he lost his life in 1633, deferred the project, but
it was carried into effect in 1638, near the present city of Wilmington.
They extended their settlements from the entrance
of Delaware bay far up the river, until the Dutch, from New
Netherlands, who claimed the country, attacked and reduced
them to submission, uniting New Sweden, as it had been called,
to their own colony, in the year 1655. It fell, with that colony,
into the hands of the English in 1664. It was included
in the grant made to William Penn, in 1692. It was long
attached to Pennsylvania, but in 1703 received permission to
form a separate government, on the wise and liberal plan pursued
by Penn. This form of government continued through
the Revolutionary war.</p>

<p>The surface of the State is level, or gently undulating, the
climate is agreeable, except that, in winter, the sea breeze is
somewhat harsh; the soil is sandy but fertile. Grain and
fruit are raised, peaches being produced in great profusion.
Her commercial and manufacturing business is limited, and
she is destitute of mineral wealth.</p>

<p>It is next to Rhode Island in size, containing the small area
of 2,120 square miles, or 1,356,800 acres. Population 125,015.</p>

<h5>RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>This is the smallest of the States, having an area of but
1,306 square miles, or 835,840 acres.</p>

<p>It was settled in 1636 by Roger Williams, and became an
avowed place of refuge for persecuted christians of all names,
but especially for Baptists, among whom Mr. Williams was a
leader. It was chartered as a separate colony in 1644, and the
excellent constitution framed under it lasted until 1818. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
was one of the original thirteen States and took an earnest
share in the struggles of the revolution, though it was not
represented in the convention that framed the Constitution,
and did not ratify it until 1790.</p>

<p>Its citizens are mainly engaged in the manufacturing and
commercial pursuits for which their excellent harbors and
streams furnish eminent facilities. It has always been prosperous,
its people being distinguished for industry and activity.
Its population was, in 1870, 217,356.</p>

<p>Rhode Island forms part of the first judicial circuit; constitutes
one judicial district; and has three ports of entry, and
seven of delivery. It has two capitals, having been originally
formed of two separate colonies. These are Providence and
Newport. The election for State officers is held on the first
Wednesday in April. The Legislature is held twice in the
year, in May and January. The style of her enacting clause
is: “It is enacted by the General Assembly, as follows.”</p>

<h5>VERMONT.</h5>

<p>This State received its name from the French name of its
range of mountains, (“verd mont” meaning “Green Mountain.”)
It was settled in 1731, and was at first considered
part of New Hampshire, and afterwards claimed by New
York. These claims were vigorously resisted, but it had
no organized government until 1777. It did good service in
the Revolution; but was not admitted into the Union until
1791, making the fourteenth State. Col. Ethan Allen at the
head of 270 “Green Mountain Boys” took possession of Forts
Ticonderoga and Crown Point in the name of the Continental
Congress, in 1775, and thus assured the northern water communication
with Canada to the Americans.</p>

<p>The climate of Vermont though cold, is pleasant and even,
the soil fertile in the valleys, and the streams supply excellent
water power, which, however, is little used. Maple sugar is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
produced in abundance, while its facilities for raising stock
are equal to those of New Hampshire. Granite, marble of
fine quality, and slate quarries abound. Its provision for education
is very liberal.</p>

<p>It has three representatives in Congress; forms part of the
second judicial circuit, and constitutes one judicial district.
One port of entry and two of delivery are authorized to be
named by the President of the United States.</p>

<p>Montpelier is the capital. The State election is held on the
first Tuesday in September, and the Legislature meets on the
first Wednesday in October.</p>

<p>The enacting clause begins: “It is hereby enacted by the
General Assembly of the State of Vermont.”</p>

<h5>KENTUCKY.</h5>

<p>Kentucky was formed from the territory of Virginia, and
in point of seniority is the fifteenth State of the American
Union, having been admitted on the first of June, 1792.</p>

<p>The <i>sobriquet</i> of “dark and bloody ground” applied to
Kentucky is very suggestive of the sanguinary conflicts of her
pioneer population with the aboriginal lords of the soil. The
celebrated Daniel Boone was among the first white men to
explore the wilderness of Kentucky. The first white settlement
was commenced at Boonesborough, about the year 1769.
The area of the State is 37,680 square miles, equal to 24,115,200
acres.</p>

<p>The climate is mild, and adapted to the production of cereals,
grapes, and fruits. The soil is very fertile. The surface presents
a varied aspect in its several portions. The southeastern
part of the State is mountainous, the central and northern portions
are undulating, sometimes hilly. The river bottoms are
very productive. The State is well timbered. Apple, pear,
peach, plum and various other fruit trees are cultivated with
great success. The staple products are corn, tobacco and
hemp. Horses, mules and cattle are raised. Kentucky abounds
in bituminous coal, lead, iron pyrites, marble, freestone, gypsum,
and cliff limestone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>The population in 1870 was 1,321,000. She is entitled to
ten representatives in Congress, is in the sixth judicial circuit
and forms one judicial district, has one port of entry, Louisville,
and two ports of delivery, viz.: Paducah and Columbus.
Frankfort is the capital.</p>

<p>The State elections are held on the first Monday in August.
The Legislature meets on the first Monday in December, and
is composed of two houses—the Senate consisting of 38 members
elected for four years; and a House of Representatives
elected for two years. The enacting clause of the laws is:
“Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth
of Kentucky.”</p>

<h5>TENNESSEE.</h5>

<p>Tennessee belonged to the territory of North Carolina while
a colony, and was settled by emigrants from it in 1757. They
built Fort Loudon in East Tennessee, but were destroyed, or
driven away, by the Indians, in 1760. Settlement was soon
resumed, but continually harrassed by Indian attacks. In 1774
Col. Lewis and Capt. Shelby attacked and defeated them. They
remained quiet until after the Declaration of Independence,
when the Cherokees were stirred up by British emissaries.
From 1776 to 1779 three several expeditions were made against
them, the Indians being decisively defeated each time. The
Cherokees and Shawnees were warlike tribes, and continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
for some years, to make occasional attacks on the settlements,
which did not, however, prevent their steady growth.</p>

<p>In 1789 North Carolina renounced her claim to the territory,
and in 1790 it became a separate province, being admitted
into the Union as a Sovereign State in 1796, making the sixteenth,
or the third admitted after the Revolutionary war—Vermont,
in 1791, being the first; and Kentucky, in 1792, the
second.</p>

<p>This State has an area of 45,600 square miles, or 29,184,000
acres. It had a population in 1870 of 1,257,983.</p>

<p>Tennessee is very agreeably diversified with mountain, hill
and dale, containing within its limits fertility of soil, beauty
of scenery, and a delightfully temperate climate. The State is
generally healthy. The soil in the main is good, and while
among the mountains it is not arable, it is favorable for grazing,
and stock is largely exported.</p>

<p>Indian corn, tobacco, and cotton are the great staples.</p>

<p>Gold has been found in the south-east portion of the State.
Among the other minerals found here are iron in abundance,
some lead, silver, zinc, marble of very fine quality, and various
others. The State is entitled to ten Representatives in Congress;
is in the sixth judicial circuit; has three judicial districts;
and has two ports of delivery—Memphis and Knoxville.</p>

<p>Nashville is the capital. The State election is held on the
first Monday in August, and the Legislature meets on the first
Monday in October, once in two years. The Legislature consists
of a Senate of twenty-five members, and a House of Representatives
of seventy-five members.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws of this State is: “Be it
enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee.”</p>

<h5>OHIO.</h5>

<p>The first permanent settlement in this important State was
made on the 7th day of April, 1788. Though this fine territory
lay nearest to the most populous and enterprising of the original
States, the intrigues of the French before the Revolution,
the hostility to which they excited the Indians, and the difficulties
arising from the various claims of different States to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
the lands, which rendered titles insecure, prevented any permanent
settlement until about the time when the present
Constitution of the United States was originated. All these
difficulties were now removed, and emigration, long restrained,
rushed like a flood down the Ohio. 20,000 persons, during
this year (1788), passed down the river in pursuit of new
homes. Cincinnati and many other places were settled about
this time. From 1790 to 1795 there was much suffering from
the hostility of the Indians; but this period having passed,
the settlements multiplied and grew apace.</p>

<p>The settlers were, in large part, from New England; accustomed
to wring a thrifty living from a rocky soil; and their
industry soon brought great results from this more generous
field. The population increased rapidly. In 14 years it
amounted to 72,000; and was admitted into the Union with
that number Nov. 29th, 1802.</p>

<p>The climate is healthy and mild, the soil generally very
fertile, and her inhabitants have made the most of it. Coal,
iron, and marble are very abundant. Manufactures have not
been much developed in this State, but they are steadily growing.
The lake on the north, and the river on the south, with
more than 5,000 miles of railway and canals, furnish all the
elements of a great and steady growth.</p>

<p>It was, on its admission, the seventeenth State in the Union.</p>

<p>It has an area of 39,964 square miles, equal to 25,576,960
acres. The population in 1870 was 2,622,214, entitling her to
twenty Members of Congress.</p>

<p>It is in the sixth judicial circuit, and forms two judicial
districts, the Northern and Southern.</p>

<p>This State has three ports of entry—Cleveland, Toledo, and
Portland; and four ports of delivery, to be located where the
President directs.</p>

<p>The capital of this State is Columbus. The State election
is now held on the second Tuesday of October. The Legislature
meets on the first Monday of January, biennially.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio.”</p>

<h5>LOUISIANA.</h5>

<p>The Spaniards, who found so much gold in other parts of the
American continent, made repeated explorations of the region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
lying near the mouths of the Mississippi in the hope of discovering
it there. Failing in this, they made no settlements.
The French planned the establishment of a vast empire covering
the best territory now in the bounds of the United States,
and explored the Mississippi and its tributaries with untiring
courage and zeal, both from the Great Lakes and from the
mouth of the river. A few years after La Salle had perished
in his bold wandering, a French naval officer, Lemoine D’Iberville,
formed the first settlement in Louisiana (so named after
the French King, Louis XIV., by La Salle.) This was in 1699;
but no great progress was made until the Mississippi Company
was formed in France, under the idea that Louisiana was rich
in gold and diamonds; when, in 1718, eight hundred persons
emigrated from France and settled at New Orleans. In 1732
the colony contained, in all, seven thousand five hundred persons,
and continued to prosper until 1763, when, by the peace
of Paris, all the French possessions in America except the territory
west of the Great River, were given up to England.
This remnant soon passed to the Spaniards, and again to the
French, from whom it was bought by President Jefferson for
$15,000,000, in 1803.</p>

<p>This purchase was regarded, even by Jefferson, as probably
exceeding the powers of the government, under the Constitution;
but it was essential to the development, unity, and
greatness of the country. The Mississippi Valley is the heart
of North America, and the use of the river as necessary to the
value of the prairie States lying east of it, as to the defense
and strength of the country. The possession of it could, alone,
make the United States a great power among nations. Napoleon
Bonaparte, then First Consul of the French Republic,
designed, in ceding it to the United States, to give England,
his relentless enemy, a powerful rival; but even his keen foresight
could not have anticipated the wonderful growth in which
the Louisiana Purchase was so necessary an element.</p>

<p>The surface of Louisiana is low, and the southern part often
overflowed by the high water of the rivers. Many islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
of great fertility and beauty lie along the coast; one of
them consisting of an immense bed or mine of rock salt.
Fruits grow to great perfection and orange trees are specially
fruitful, a single tree often bearing 5,000 oranges. Cotton and
cane sugar are the principal staples. New Orleans has an
extensive commerce, and manufactures will sometime find in it
a profitable field. The palmy days of this, as of all the other
Southern States, is in the future; her most valuable resources
having been scarcely touched. New Orleans will naturally
become the third great commercial city of the Union, New
York and San Francisco, only, being likely to take precedence
of her.</p>

<p>Louisiana was admitted into the Union April 8th, 1812,
making the eighteenth State.</p>

<p>She has an area of 46,431 square miles, equal to 29,715,840
acres. The population in 1870 numbered 732,731; she has
six Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>Louisiana forms a part of the fifth judicial circuit, and constitutes
two judicial districts, viz.: the eastern and western
districts of Louisiana. This State has one collection district,
denominated the district of New Orleans; which city is the
only port of entry. The shores of the river Ohio, and all the
rivers emptying into the Mississippi, are attached to the district
of New Orleans, though most of them do not lie in the
State. Several of the cities and towns on these rivers are made
ports of delivery. Collection districts are not always confined
to one State.</p>

<p>New Orleans is the capital. The Legislature meets on the
first Monday in January, once in two years. The State election
is held on the first Monday in November.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of her laws is as follows: “Be it enacted
by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of
Louisiana, in General Assembly convened.”</p>

</div>

<h5>INDIANA.</h5>

<p>1. Indiana was first explored by the enterprising French
Jesuits, who highly appreciated the beauty, resources, and
grand future of the vast Mississippi valley. Wiser than their
sovereign, Louis XIV., they would have taken firm and effectual
possession of all this region, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
but Louis was too much occupied with his palaces, the splendor
of his court, the banishment of Protestants, and war with
his neighbors to lend a due support to their plans. They
explored the region in 1682, formed a settlement at Vincennes
in 1730, and made friends of the Indians. The career of the
French, in Europe and America, was checked by the extravagance
of the Court, and disastrous wars; and this little colony
remained for nearly three generations solitary and stationary
in the wilderness; fraternizing with the Indians and enjoying
life as only the French can under such dreary circumstances.</p>

<p>2. After the Revolution all this region was included in the
Northwest Territory. The grim earnestness of the Americans
in pushing their fortunes alarmed, without conciliating, the
Indians, and for a long time a deadly struggle alone could preserve
the growing settlements from total extinction. The
brave and talented Tecumseh and his twin brother, the Prophet,
made a desperate effort to drive back or exterminate the settlers;
but they were conquered, and the Indians retreated, step
by step, before the advancing flood of emigration. In 1809
Indiana was erected in to a separate Territory, and admitted into
the Union as a separate State on the 11th of Dec., 1816. It is
275 miles long by 135 in width. The surface is mainly level
or gently undulating; the irregularities in the southern part,
seldom rising more than two hundred feet, but with a rocky
foundation to the soil, presenting many advantages to manufactures
along the streams; these facilities are increased by the
extent and value of bituminous coal deposits which underlie
nearly one-fourth of the area of the State.</p>

<p>3. Indiana has a happier mixture of prairie and woodland
than any other western State. Its commercial facilities are
great. Reaching Lake Michigan on the northwest, Chicago
forms a fine metropolis for the northern parts; while the Ohio
on the south furnishes cheap transportation to Cincinnati and
Pittsburg toward the east, or New Orleans to the southwest.
Lying between the fertile and busy regions west and the great
eastern markets, it is crossed in all directions by railroads. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
is in the centre of the most highly favored part of the Union,
and its advantages and resources seem boundless. Its staple
in agriculture is corn, but all the grains, vegetables, and fruits
of the temperate zone are raised with success. The climate is
mild, but it lies in the region of variableness in weather characterizing
all the western States in its latitude.</p>

<p>The resources of the State have been in a course of rapid
and uninterrupted development for 60 years, but they are so
great, and there are so many other inviting fields luring emigrants
further west, that a comparatively small part of its
wealth has yet been reached. There is a magnificent provision
for education, and its intelligent and enterprising citizens are
worthy of the Great Republic.</p>

<p>4. Indiana was the nineteenth State in the Union. She has
an area of 33,809 square miles, equal to 21,637,760 acres. Her
population in 1870 was 1,673,046, which entitles her to thirteen
Representatives in Congress. Indiana is the seventh judicial
circuit, and forms one judicial district. There is no port of
entry in this State; but there are three ports of delivery,
to-wit: Evansville, New Albany, and Madison which are
attached to the New Orleans collection district.</p>

<p>The capital is Indianapolis. The State election is held on
the second Tuesday of October. The Legislature meets only
once in two years, on the first Wednesday of January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of her laws is in these words: “Be it
enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana.”</p>

<h5>MISSISSIPPI.</h5>

<p>This State was explored by De Soto, a companion of Pizarro,
in his cruel conquest of Peru, in 1541, and later by the enterprising
French governor of Canada, La Salle, in 1684. The
first settlement was made by the French, at Natchez, in 1716.
It was one of a chain of settlements by which they proposed to
connect the basins of the St. Lawrence and the great lakes with
the Mississippi valley and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>The Natchez Indians gave the early colonists great trouble,
but were finally so completely conquered that the national
name became extinct, the few remnants surviving, becoming
incorporated with other tribes. They were supposed to have
anciently emigrated from Mexico or South America, some of
their customs being similar to those of the Peruvians.</p>

<p>In 1763 the French ceded all this territory to England,
except that of Louisiana, which became the possession of Spain.</p>

<p>The Choctaw Indians held possession of the northern part of
the State for a long time, and became considerably civilized.</p>

<p>The northern part of the State is prairie, the soil being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
extremely rich, while the south is sandy. The surface is generally
level or undulating. Commerce and agriculture form its
principal resources; though neither have been highly developed.
Cotton is the principal staple. It is remarkably well
adapted to the growth of fruit, though it has been very little
cultivated. The State is well supplied with railroads, which,
with the Mississippi flowing the whole length of her western
boundary, furnish ample transportation for all the produce of
her fertile soil.</p>

<p>The Territory of Mississippi became a State in 1817; making
the twentieth State. The area is 47,156 square miles,
equal to 30,179,840 acres. The population in 1870 numbered
834,170; which entitles her to six Representatives in Congress.
The State lies in the fifth judicial circuit, and is divided into
two judicial districts, viz.: the Northern and Southern districts
of Mississippi. She has three ports of entry, viz.: Natchez,
Vicksburg, and one near the mouth of Pearl river, to be established
whenever the President may direct; also three ports of
delivery, viz.: Grand Gulf, Ship Island and Columbus.</p>

<p>Jackson is the capital. The State election is held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and her Legislature
meets biennially on the Tuesday after the first Monday in
January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is in these words: “Be it
enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
State of Mississippi in General Assembly convened.”</p>

<h5>ILLINOIS.</h5>

<p>Illinois was first visited by Europeans in the persons of
French Jesuit missionaries in the year 1672, who explored
eastern Wisconsin and northern Illinois in that year. The
oldest permanent settlement in the valley of the Mississippi
was made at Kaskaskia, in this State, in the year 1720, by the
French. The name of the State is derived from the aboriginal
inhabitants. In the Indian dialect it was “Illini,” and signified
a perfectly formed man. The French settlers changed the
name to Illinois. This State was formed from what was known
as the Northwestern territory, and was the twenty-first of the
American Union. It was admitted and became an independent
State on the 3d day of December, 1818. It has an area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
55,405 square miles, equal to 35,459,200 acres. Its population
in 1870 was 2,539,638. Extending through more than
five degrees of latitude, Illinois has quite a variety of climate.
The surface is level. The soil is fertile and the agricultural
capabilities of this State are not surpassed by any sister State,
if indeed by any portion of earth’s surface, of equal extent.
Her staple products are corn, wheat, oats, potatoes, hay, and
products of the dairy, besides large quantities of fruit. The
State is rich in minerals. A large portion of the lead producing
region of the country is in this State. Bituminous
coal is found in almost every county in the State. Copper is
found in large quantities in the north, and iron in both south
and north. Lime, zinc, marble of excellent quality, freestone,
gypsum, and other minerals, are found in various parts.</p>

<p>The State is entitled to nineteen representatives in Congress,
and forms a part of the seventh judicial circuit. It forms two
judicial districts, viz.: northern and southern. It has one port
of entry, Chicago, and four ports of delivery, viz.: Alton,
Quincy, Cairo, and Peoria. The capital is Springfield. The
State election is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in
November. The legislature meets biennially on the first Monday
in January. The enacting clause of the laws is as follows:
“Be it enacted by the people of the State of Illinois represented
in the General Assembly.”</p>

</div>

<h5>ALABAMA.</h5>

<p>This State was, at first, held by Georgia under her colonial
charter, but was given up to the general government, in 1802,
for the sum of $1,250,000. It then became a part of the
Mississippi territory, but was separated when Mississippi
became a State, in 1817.</p>

<p>It was settled in 1711, at Mobile, by the French, it being a
part of the territory explored and claimed for France by
La Salle in 1684. The Indian name of Alabama means “Here
we rest.” Its soil can scarcely be excelled for fertility in the
world. It has every variety of climate, from the high and
stern severity of a mountain region in the north, through all
gradations, to the heat and luxuriant vegetation of the tropics
along the southern coast. The center abounds in coal and
iron, and various other minerals are found in abundance.
Until the Revolution it was a hunting ground for the Indians.
Being then stirred up by British emissaries, and threatening
the security of the frontiers, they were severely chastised.
After the return of peace, when the growing wealth and population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
of the original States excited them to enterprise, the
territory invited population by its surpassing fertility, and it
graduated to the importance of a sovereign State by admission
into the Union, Dec. 14th, 1819, forming the twenty-second
State.</p>

<p>It has an area of 50,722 square miles, equal to 32,462,080
acres, and had a population in 1870 of 966,988, by which she
is entitled to eight Representatives.</p>

<p>It forms a part of the fifth judicial circuit, and is divided into
three judicial districts, the Northern, Middle and Southern.</p>

<p>It has one port of entry, (Mobile,) and two ports of delivery,
viz.: Tuscumbia and Selma.</p>

<p>The capital of the State is Montgomery.</p>

<p>The State election is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday
in November. The Legislature meets on the third Monday
in November.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of its laws is as follows: “Be it enacted
by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of
Alabama, in General Assembly convened.”</p>

<h5>MAINE.</h5>

<p>This State forms the northeastern boundary of the Republic;
Canada and New Brunswick lying north and east. It was at
first a province, granted by charter to Sir Ferdinand Gorges,
by the King of England, in 1638; but was united with Massachusetts
by purchase in 1652. It was settled by the English,
at Bristol, in 1625. It was admitted as a State into the Union
March 15th, 1820, being the twenty-third in order of admission.
It contains 31,766 square miles, or 20,330,240 acres in
area. In 1870 the population was 626,463.</p>

<p>It has now five Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>The northern part of this State is almost a wilderness, and
furnishes large quantities of lumber, which are floated down
her large rivers, and supplied, in great abundance, to the
Atlantic seaports, and the West Indies. Ship-building is an
extensive branch of industry, the great length and irregular
line of coast forming numerous harbors. It has extensive
fisheries, and a large sea-faring population. Its numerous
streams are highly favorable to manufactures, though comparatively
little has as yet been done in this direction. The climate
is severe and the soil somewhat sterile, so that it ranks low as
an agricultural State. It has received comparatively few
additions to its population by foreign immigration; and its
inhabitants are mainly from the old English stock, and the
State ranks high in morality. It depletes itself by furnishing,
like many other of the older States, annually, a large number
of vigorous, enterprising young men to settle the new and
fertile regions of the west.</p>

<p>It forms part of the first judicial circuit, and constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
one judicial district. It has thirteen ports of entry, and thirty-two
ports of delivery.</p>

<p>The capital is Augusta, on the Kennebec river.</p>

<p>The State elections are held on the second Monday of September;
and the Legislature meets on the first Wednesday of
January in each year.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of its laws is: “Be it enacted by the
Senate and House of Representatives, in Legislature assembled.”</p>

<h5>MISSOURI.</h5>

<p>This State was first settled by the French, at or near the present
capital, in the year 1719. Here a fort was established,
called Fort Orleans, and the neighboring lead mines were
worked the next year. St. Genevieve, the oldest town in the
State, was settled in 1755, and St. Louis in 1764. In 1763 it,
with all the territory west of the Mississippi, was assigned by
treaty to Spain. This territory was ceded back to France in
1801, and with Louisiana was purchased by the United States
in 1803. It remained a part of Louisiana until the admission
of the State of that name, when the remaining portion of that
purchase was called Missouri. In 1821 it was admitted into
the Union, forming the twenty-fourth State. This State has
an area of 67,380 square miles, equal to 43,123,200 acres.</p>

<p>Her population in 1870 was 1,715,000, entitling her to thirteen
Representatives in Congress.</p>

<p>The climate of Missouri is variable; in winter the thermometer
sinks below zero; the summers are excessively hot; the
air is dry and pure. The State is quite as healthful as any in
the west. The soil is good and of great agricultural capabilities.
The great staple is Indian corn. The other products
cultivated largely are hemp, wheat, oats, tobacco. Sheep and
cattle are considerably raised, and fruit culture is successful.</p>

<p>This State is in the eighth judicial circuit; and forms two
judicial districts, the Eastern and Western. It has no port of
entry, and but one port of delivery, Hannibal.</p>

<p>The capital is Jefferson City. The State election is held on
the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and the
Legislature meets on the last Monday of December. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
enacting clause of the laws is: “Be it enacted by the General
Assembly of the State of Missouri as follows.”</p>

</div>

<h5>MICHIGAN.</h5>

<p>The name of this State is a contraction of two words in the
Chippewa language, meaning “Great Lake,” and was applied,
by the Indians, to the two surrounding the lower peninsula.
It was explored by Jesuit missionaries, who established numerous
missions among various Indian tribes, and pushed their
way, through perils and fatigues, west to the Mississippi, which,
they followed far north and south; to be soon outstripped by
the adventurous La Salle. Detroit was founded about 1701.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
The settlements made little progress under French rule; and
when, in 1763, it passed under English control, the conspiracy
of Pontiac nearly destroyed them. It was not till 1796 that
the United States government took possession of the territory.
Its growth was much retarded by the war of 1812, when it
endured, for two years, all the barbarities of Indian war.</p>

<p>A territorial government was organized in 1805. In 1818
the lands were brought into the market, since which its prosperity
has been uninterrupted. It is remarkable in its position,
and eminently so by its resources. The southern peninsula
is very productive. The northern peninsula contains the richest
copper mines in the world, and unlimited supplies of iron,
while the quantity of the finest lumber, and the facilities for
transporting it are superior. The fish taken in its lakes are
excellent and abundant; its people are enterprising and intelligent;
and its State authorities have established one of the
best Universities in the Union. Its future promises to become
equal at least to that of the most favored State.</p>

<p>The Territory of Michigan was changed into a State preliminarily
June 15, 1836, and was fully admitted to an equality
with all the States January 26, 1837, making the twenty-fifth
State (Arkansas was admitted on the same day). Her
area is 56,243 square miles, equal to 35,995,520 acres. The
population in 1870 was 1,184,296, which entitles her to nine
Representatives in Congress. By an act of 1866, Michigan
was located in the sixth judicial circuit; and forms two judicial
districts, and has four collection districts and four ports of entry,
viz.: Detroit, Port Huron, Grand Haven, and Michilimackinac;
also five ports of delivery (if the President deem them necessary).</p>

<p>The capital is Lansing. The State election is held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The Legislature
meets biennially on the first Wednesday in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “The people
of the State of Michigan enact.”</p>

<h5>ARKANSAS.</h5>

<p>Arkansas was originally a portion of the Territory of Louisiana.
It remained a part of that territory until 1812, when
the present State of Louisiana was admitted into the Union.
The remainder of the territory was then formed into the Missouri
Territory, and so remained until 1821 when Missouri
was admitted into the Union, and Arkansas was erected into
a separate territory, bearing the present name. In 1836, a
State constitution was formed at Little Rock, and Arkansas
became a State in the Union. It constituted the twenty-sixth
State. It has an area of 52,193 square miles, equal to 33,406,720
acres. The population in 1870 was 483,197, which entitles
her to four Representatives in Congress. The eastern portion
of the State, extending back one hundred miles from the Mississippi,
is generally a vast plain covered with marshes, swamps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
and lagoons. The Ozark mountains which enter the northwest
part of the State divide it into two unequal parts, of
which the northern has the climate and productions of the
Northern States, while the southern portion, in climate and
productions, resembles Mississippi and Louisiana. The lowlands
of Arkansas are unhealthy, while the more elevated portions
of the State will compare favorably with the most healthful
and invigorating portions of the Northwest. There is a
great variety of soil in this State. While some portions, like
the river bottoms, are exceedingly fertile, other parts are sterile
and barren.</p>

<p>The staple products are Indian corn, cotton and live stock.
Arkansas gives indications of rich mineral resources.</p>

<p>This State lies in the eighth judicial circuit, and forms two
judicial districts, the eastern and western. It has no ports of
entry or delivery.</p>

<p>The capital of the State is Little Rock. She holds her State
election the first Monday in November. The Legislature
meets but once in two years, on the first Monday in January.
The enacting clause of the laws is: “Be it enacted by the General
Assembly of the State of Arkansas.”</p>

<h5>FLORIDA.</h5>

<p>This peninsula was discovered by Ponce de Leon, a companion
of Columbus, in 1512, on Easter Sunday, called by the
Spaniards Pascua Florida, which, with the profusion of flowers
found at this early season in that tropical region, caused him
to name it Florida—“the flowery land.” It was first colonized
by French Huguenots, for whom Admiral Coligni desired to
find an asylum in the new world, from the fierce bigotry of the
times. The first settlers (1564) became discouraged and
returned; the second colony, established in 1566, was destroyed
by the Spaniards. These founded a settlement in 1565 at St.
Augustine, which was the oldest town in the United States
settled by Europeans. It remained in their hands until 1763,
when, by the terms of the “Peace of Paris,” it fell into the
hands of the English. It was returned to Spain in 1783.</p>

<p>It was acquired from Spain by treaty made with the United
States in 1819, but the American authorities did not take possession
until July, 1821. The consideration given by our government
was about five million dollars. It is a point running out
from the Southeast border of our territory, of but little elevation
above the sea level, and swampy, but covered with an
exuberant growth of vegetation with a chain of lakes from
south to north through the center. The warmth of the climate,
where no winter is ever known, promotes the growth of the
rarest and most beautiful flowers; the clustering vines and
dense foliage render its forests almost impenetrable, and its
delicate mosses are the wonder and delight of the naturalist;
while the splendid plumage of its tropical birds, flitting among
the lemon and orange groves, laden at once with bud, flower
and fruit, combine to add the scenery of the equatorial regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
to the homely but more useful vegetable growth and beauty of
our temperate zone. It is a resort of invalids during the
rigors of the northern winter, its otherwise excessive heat being
tempered by the sea breezes from either side. With its
marshes drained and its vegetable growth subdued and guided
by the industrious agriculturist, its supply of the fruits and
other production of warm climates would be inexhaustible.
It is but partially settled, and its agricultural, commercial,
and manufacturing facilities but slightly developed. Its wealth
of resources remain to reward the enterprise and industry of
the future. The railroad connections between its cities and
other States furnish a sufficient basis for improvement.</p>

<p>Florida was admitted into the Union, March 3, 1845; making
the twenty-seventh State. This State has an area of 59,268
square miles, equal to 37,931,520 acres. The population in
1870 amounted to 187,756. She has two Representative in
Congress.</p>

<p>Florida lies in the fifth judicial circuit, and forms two judicial
districts; and has seven ports of entry—St. Augustine,
Key West, Apalachicola, Pensacola, Magnolia, St. John’s
River, and Fernandina; and two ports of delivery—Palatka
and Bay Port.</p>

<p>The capital is Tallahassee. The State election is held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The Legislature
meets on the Tuesday after the first Monday in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is: “Be it enacted by the
Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Florida, in
General Assembly convened.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="500px;">
<img src="images/state-ia.jpg" width="500" height="235" alt="Illustration of Iowa state seal" />
</div>

<h5>IOWA.</h5>

<p>1. The name of this State in the Indian tongue is said to
mean “<i>This is the Land.</i>” Few States have a surface, soil,
and position so uniformly excellent for all their different sections.
A high rolling prairie, well drained by streams, of
great fertility, and almost no sterile or waste land; beautiful
to look upon in its alternations of rise and fall, of prairie,
stream, and timber; bounded on its extremes by the two mighty
branches of the “Father of Waters,” with numerous smaller
rivers hundreds of miles in length within its limits; its southern
region underlaid by a vast bed of coal, its northern rich in
deposits of lead; a climate free from the severity of Minnesota
and Wisconsin winters, and from the intemperate heats of
Missouri and Kentucky summers, it is a land to be satisfied
with; and justifies the picturesque name given it by its ancient
appreciative owners.</p>

<p>2. It was first visited by Europeans in 1673. Marquette
and Joliet, two French Jesuit missionaries, whom the vast
magnitudes of the North American continent seemed to stimulate
like new wine, roamed alone over these immense distances,
preserved by their characteristic French cordiality from
the suspicion and hostility of the numerous warlike Indian
tribes—who everywhere received them with hospitality, treated
them with respect, and dismissed them with assistance—passed,
in that year, down the Mississippi, and, landing a little
above the mouth of the Moingona—which, from the similarity
of sound, they corrupted into Des Moines, (Monk’s River)—they
fearlessly followed an Indian trail fourteen miles into the
interior to an Indian village. Some tradition or prophecy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
forewarned the Indians of venerable white visitors, and they
were received at once as expected and honored guests. The
new religion they announced, and the authority of the king of
France which they proclaimed, raised no remonstrance or hostile
feeling, and they were sent on their way down the river
with the “Pipe of Peace.” The grand visions of the future
entertained by these and other French explorers were never
realized by that nation. It was more than a hundred years
later that the first settlement was made by Julian Du Buque on
the site of the present city of that name. He obtained a grant
of 180,000 acres from the Indians, established a trading post,
and worked the lead mines, with great profit; but the time had
not come for dispossessing the Indians, and almost fifty years
more passed before any other settlement was attempted.</p>

<p>3. In 1832 the Winnebagoes, Sacs, and Foxes united under
the Winnebago chief, Black Hawk, to invade and repossess the
lands in Illinois which they had ceded to the government.
Gen. Atkinson met and defeated them on the Upper Iowa, taking
Black Hawk and his son prisoners. They were taken east,
kindly treated, and set at liberty; and in the following year a
treaty was made which ultimately extinguished the Indian
title to the whole of Iowa, the Indians removing west of the
Missouri. In the same year a settlement was made at Burlington.
The time for Iowa had come. In 1834 it was joined
to the Territory of Michigan, in 1837 was reorganized as part
of the Wisconsin territory, and, in 1838, became a separate
territory with the capital at Burlington. March 3d, 1845, it
was conditionally, and Dec. 28th, 1846, fully admitted into
the Union as a Sovereign State. In 1840 it had a population
of over 40,000, in 1850 of nearly 200,000. A steady growth
followed, and she has now, probably, a million and a half of
inhabitants. Four parallel lines of railroad pass entirely across
the State from east to west, three from north to south, and
various others are in process of building or form intersecting
lines. She is scarcely yet fully launched into her career of
greatness. When her virgin soil shall all be broken up and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
hidden wealth evoked by her intelligent and skillful agriculturists,
when the full tide of commerce on her two great rivers
shall have set in to supplement her railroads, and mature
organization shall have made all her resources available, she
will take her proper place in the first rank of States in the
Union, and her citizens will repeat with satisfaction and pride
the Indian declaration, “This is the Land.”</p>

<p>Iowa was the twenty-eighth State, on its admission, in 1845.
It has an area of 55,045 square miles, equal to 35,228,800 acres.
The population in 1870 was 1,191,802, which entitles her to
nine Representatives in Congress. This State lies in the eighth
judicial circuit, and makes one judicial district. She has no
port of entry, but has three ports of delivery, to-wit: Burlington,
Keokuk, and Dubuque; all of which are attached to the
collection district of New Orleans, in the State of Louisiana.</p>

<p>Des Moines is the capital. The State election is held on the
second Tuesday of October. The Legislature meets biennially
on the second Monday in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of her laws is in these words: “Be it
enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Iowa.”</p>

<h5>TEXAS.</h5>

<p>This State forms the southwestern portion of the United
States. The first settlement in Texas was made on Matagorda
bay, under the French led by La Salle, in 1685. It passed
into the possession of the Spanish in the year 1690.</p>

<p>After the independence of Mexico, in 1822, Texas remained
a Mexican province until the revolution of 1836, when it gained
its independence. It continued an independent republic, modeled
on the United States, until 1845, when, the Texan Congress
having accepted the conditions imposed by the Congress
of the United States, it became the 29th State in the Union.
It has an area of 237,504 square miles, equal to 152,002,560
acres. The population in 1870 was 797,500, which entitles
her to six members of Congress.</p>

<p>This State embraces every variety of surface; mountain, plain,
hill, and desert waste lie within its limits. The climate is free
from the extremes of both the temperate and torrid zones,
producing, in the north, many of the products of the temperate,
and in the south many of those of the torrid zone. The
variation in the temperature from the season of winter to that
of summer is quite small, giving the State as equable a climate
as any in the world. While it shares the genial climate of the
“sunny South” it is free from all the deadly swamp exhalations
of the lower Mississippi States. The soil, on the whole,
is as fertile as any in the world. It furnishes the very best
natural pasture all the year round. Cotton in large quantities—Indian
corn, wheat, rye, oats and other small grains—tobacco,
indigo and rice, are the staple products. The grape, mulberry
and the vanilla, are indigenous and abundant. Cayenne pepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
is grown in vast quantities. Fruit is no less various and abundant
than its other products. The peach, nectarine, fig, plum,
quince and a great variety of berries flourish here. Oranges,
lemons, limes and melons, grow well. Live stock of all varieties
and in vast numbers fatten on the plains, and are shipped
in all directions to supply every demand.</p>

<p>Texas abounds in minerals. Rich silver mines are already
worked successfully at San Saba. Gold in small quantities
has been found west of the Colorado river. Coal is abundant.
Iron is found in many parts of the State. There are also salt
lakes and salt springs, copper, alum, lime, agates, chalcedony,
jasper and a white and red sandstone.</p>

<p>Texas lies in the fifth judicial circuit, and makes two judicial
districts, the eastern and the western. There are three
collection districts in the State. The respective ports of entry
for these districts are Galveston, La Salle, and Brazos Santiago.
To these are attached nine ports of delivery.</p>

<p>The capital is Austin. The Legislature is composed of a
Senate, elected for four years, and a House of Representatives,
elected for two years. The sessions of the Legislature are
biennial and are held in December. The Governor is elected
for four years.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="500px;">
<img src="images/state-wi.jpg" width="500" height="235" alt="Illustration of Wisconsin state seal" />
</div>

<h5>WISCONSIN.</h5>

<p>1. This State was visited and crossed by the early French
explorers about 1665, and a settlement was made at Green Bay
in 1669 and soon after on the Mississippi, at Prairie du Chien.
It was the policy of these enterprising men to connect the
French settlements on the lower St. Lawrence by a chain of
stations on the lakes and rivers with the mouth of the Mississippi.
This would have passed through the heart of the
country and have laid open its chief resources at once. It was
a bold conception. We see it nowhere among the English
explorers and settlers, who seemed not to like to lose sight of
their ships; but it is quite in keeping with the grand and
rapid genius of the French; and, as in so many other cases, by
attempting too much they lost the whole. The English, if
slower, were sure, and consolidated their possessions on the
coast, gradually pushing westward as they were able to hold
their ground.</p>

<p>2. The French explorers have left traces of their untiring
activity in the names of rivers and places, and even Indian
tribes, but the attention of their home government was soon
withdrawn from them. No further extension was given to
settlement for near 150 years, notwithstanding it was so easy
of access from the south by the Mississippi river, and from the
east by the chain of great lakes. Very fortunately, as it now
seems, all this vast and valuable territory in the heart of the
continent, equal, perhaps in its natural wealth, to the original
resources of the whole of Europe, was reserved to reward the
labors and consolidate the beneficent power of a Nation of
Freemen, carefully trained and adapted to their high destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The tide of emigration flowed westward by way of the
Ohio river, and the States south were settled and admitted into
the Union long before Wisconsin received even a Territorial
government. This occurred in 1836, and in 1840 the census
gave it but little over 30,000 inhabitants. Population now flowed
steadily to it and we find, in 1850, over 300,000 inhabitants.
It was admitted into the Union in 1848, making the thirtieth
State. Its high latitude probably had something to do with
this deferred settlement, the milder winters of the more southern
range of States attracting the emigrants first. The climate,
however, has important advantages over the States in question,
being drier, less changeable, and not so subject to extremes. It
is very healthy, and probably the oldest man in the country
was living, hale and hearty, in this State, a few years ago, at
the patriarchal age of 139. The climate is milder than in the
same latitude farther east.</p>

<p>4. The surface is a high rolling prairie, open and mostly
treeless, except near streams and bodies of water in the south,
but in the north covered with timber. Vast forests of
pine grow on the northern slope, which is some 1,200 feet
above the level of the sea. Some parts of the State fall 600
feet below that elevation; and a succession of ridges having a
general direction east and west, separate the rivers flowing into
Lake Superior, Green Bay, and Lake Michigan, while many
streams flow southwest into the Mississippi. The State is 285
miles long by 255 wide. Its beautiful prairies, gratefully
returning a bountiful harvest to the intelligent farmer; its
numerous charming lakes and ponds; its remarkable commercial
advantages by lakes and rivers, supplemented by canals and
railroads; its great manufacturing facilities, and valuable mineral
deposits, give great promise to its future. Wheat is the
leading agricultural staple, but all the grains, vegetables, and
fruits of the Northern States well reward cultivation. It has
an area of 52,924 square miles, equal to 34,511,360 acres. In
1870 the population amounted to 1,055,167, which gave her
eight Members of Congress. Wisconsin lies in the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
judicial circuit (which is composed of Wisconsin, Indiana and
Illinois,) and forms one judicial district. It has one collection
district, one port of entry (Milwaukee,) and five ports of delivery,
viz.: Southport, Racine, Sheboygan, Green Bay and
Depere.</p>

<p>The capital of the State is Madison. The Legislature meets
on the second Wednesday in January. The State election is on
the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of her laws is as follows: “The people
of Wisconsin, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows.”</p>

<h5>CALIFORNIA</h5>

<p>Is said to have been visited by the Spaniards in 1542, and by
Sir Francis Drake, a celebrated English navigator, in 1578.
The first mission was founded by Spanish Catholics in 1769.
It was sparsely settled by Mexican rancheros, who occupied
themselves chiefly in raising cattle. In 1846 Fremont, who
had been conducting an exploring party across the great plains
and the Rocky Mountains, defeated in conjunction with Commodore
Stockton, the Mexican forces in California, and took
possession of it in the name of the United States; to which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
was definitely ceded by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Feb.
2nd, 1848; the United States government paying Mexico for
that territory and New Mexico $15,000,000, besides paying
$3,500,000 indemnity, due from Mexico to citizens of the
United States.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this arrangement been made, when it was published
that California was rich in gold, and adventurers from
all sections of the Union, and various countries of the Old
World, rushed in like a flood. For some years, society there,
composed in large part, of the wildest and most ungovernable
elements of old communities, was like a seething volcano; but,
to the immortal honor of American citizens, it was subdued by
the superior resolution and summary vigor of the better class
of emigrants from the States, and was admitted into the Union
on the 7th of Sept. 1850, with a clause in its Constitution prohibiting
slavery. The discussion in Congress on this point
came near precipitating the Civil War that broke out ten years
later. The difficulty between the slavery and anti-slavery
parties was adjusted by compromise measures, for the time, but
only served to allay the agitation produced by conflict of interests
and opinions, which was irreconcilable.</p>

<p>California “The Golden,” proved extraordinarily rich in
precious metals and other minerals, as quicksilver, platinum,
asphaltum, iron, lead, and rare qualities of marble. Its gold
mines alone from 1858 to 1868 produced over $800,000,000.</p>

<p>It is a broken country, traversed by two ranges of mountains.
The valleys are exceedingly productive. They are
unexcelled for wheat; all kinds of fruit grow in the greatest
perfection; and the grape culture promises to equal, if
not to excel, the products of the most famous vineyards of
Europe. Surprising as is her mineral wealth, her agricultural
possibilities are far greater, and her commerce is already
immense, and bids fair, from her position and relations to
Eastern Asia, and the western parts of South America, to rival
that of the Atlantic States.</p>

<p>The world was ripe for the discovery of these unparalleled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
treasures, and civilization was prepared to use them for the
good of mankind. The ready passage across the vast and
inhospitable deserts of the American continent, by means of
railways, has already changed (and will probably change still
more in the future) the course of commerce; and San Francisco
and New York may hope to rule, in large part, the
commerce of the world.</p>

<p>California is remarkable for the salubrity of its climate,
where the rigors of winter (save on the mountains), and the
excessive heats of summer are equally unknown, and for the
variety and magnitude of its natural curiosities. Of the last
the Yosemite valley and the Big Trees are the most prominent.
She has near 1,000 miles of railroad, and has made ample provision
for education.</p>

<p>California was the thirty-first State. It has an area of 188,982
square miles, equal to 120,948,480 acres. The population in
1870 was 560,285, entitling her to four Representatives in
Congress.</p>

<p>By act of 1866, this State, with Oregon and Nevada, constitutes
the ninth judicial circuit, and forms two judicial
districts. California has seven ports of entry, viz.: San Francisco,
Monterey, San Diego, Sacramento, Sonoma, San Joaquin
and San Pedro; also, one port of delivery, Santa Barbara.
California was obtained from Mexico by conquest in 1846.</p>

<p>The capital is Sacramento. She holds her State election on
the first Tuesday in September. Her Legislature meets on the
first Monday in December, but meets only once in two years.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of her laws is: “The people of the State
of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows.”</p>

<h5>MINNESOTA.</h5>

<p>This State might be called the Mother of Rivers, since it
contains the high watershed, or tableland, where the rivers
sending their waters to two oceans, in three directions, have
their sources. The head waters of the Mississippi, the St.
Lawrence, and the streams flowing into the frozen ocean of the
north are all found here. In 1680 the unwearied La Salle
visited the head waters of the Mississippi, but this region was
long left to the sole occupation of the Indians.</p>

<p>Fort Snelling, near St. Paul, was built in 1819. No other
territory was acquired, by extinction of the Indian title to the
soil, until 1837; and in 1849 the civilized population gathered
about the trading posts and missions amounted to less than
5,000. It then received a Territorial government. A considerable
portion of the State having in 1851 been ceded, by
treaty with the Indians, to the government, was immediately
entered on by the settlers; and in 1858 it was prepared to
take rank among the sovereign States. It was admitted in
May of this year, by act of Congress.</p>

<p>In 1862 the State passed through the appalling crisis of an
Indian massacre of the outlying settlements. It began without
warning, in the midst of fancied security, and before adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
protection could be forwarded, some 500 men, women, and
children were murdered with all the accompaniments of
savage cruelty. Some $3,000,000 of property was destroyed.
In a short time sufficient force was gathered to overpower the
savages, and they were in large part removed from the State.</p>

<p>The surface is undulating and high, and the soil, in good
part, extremely fertile. Portions are open and rolling prairie;
the remainder heavily wooded. Though the winters are
long and cold, the air is dry and invigorating, and the climate
healthy. It is specially favorable to the growth of wheat.
Commerce is favored by the Mississippi, navigable to St.
Paul, and by good harbors on Lake Superior, as well as by
numerous railways. Its provision for education is excellent,
and a State University at St. Anthony’s Falls promises to
form a suitable crown to its intellectual advantages.</p>

<p>This State was admitted into the Union on the 11th day of
May, 1858, and made the thirty-second State. It has an area
of 83,531 square miles, equal to 53,459,840 acres. The population
in 1870 amounted to 435,511. This State is entitled to
three Members of Congress.</p>

<p>It lies in the eighth judicial circuit, which is composed of
Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas and Minnesota. Minnesota
forms one judicial district, and has no ports of entry or
delivery.</p>

<p>St. Paul is the capital. The Legislature meets annually on
the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The State
election is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in
January.</p>

<img src="images/state-or.jpg" width="500" height="235" alt="Illustration of Oregon state seal" />
</div>

<h5>OREGON.</h5>

<p>Was discovered by Spanish adventurers in the sixteenth
century. In 1792 Capt. Grey, of Boston, discovered the
Columbia river and entered it, securing the sovereignty of the
country to the United States by right of first exploration. It
was more thoroughly explored by Lewis and Clark, appointed
for that purpose by the United States government, in 1804-5-6.
The northern part, (now Washington Territory,) was claimed
by Great Britain, and the conflicting claims produced long and
dangerous diplomatic contention, which was finally peaceably
ended in favor of the United States.</p>

<p>In 1811 a fur trading company established a fort and settlement
at the mouth of the Columbia, which was taken possession
of by the English in the latter part of 1813. The country
was claimed by them until 1846, when the boundaries were
settled by treaty; giving Oregon to the United States. Settlement
from the States, however, commenced in 1839, and continued
to increase until 1848, when a territorial government
was organized. The excitement consequent on the discovery
of gold in California drew off many of its citizens; but was,
in part, counteracted by the extraordinary inducements made
to actual settlers. A State constitution was adopted by the
people Nov. 9th, 1857, but it was not admitted, by act of Congress,
into the Union, until Feb. 14th, 1859, making the thirty-third
State.</p>

<p>The surface of the country is divided by three ranges of
mountains, the Cascade, Blue and Rocky mountains. The
Cascade Range has the highest peaks found in the United
States. The climate is mild near the coast, but more severe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
higher eastern parts. The high eastern regions are volcanic,
containing vast tracts of lava, entirely sterile; the middle is
well adapted to grazing, in many parts. The valuable farming
lands are in the western division, along the various tributary
streams of the Columbia. Wheat is the great staple; rye,
oats, and vegetables, are grown with success. Fruit is also
produced in abundance. Its supply of coal and copper is said
to be unlimited; and it is specially celebrated for its extensive
forests of gigantic trees. Manufactures and commerce are, as
yet, undeveloped; but will be important in the future. Little
has been done in the way of internal improvement.</p>

<p>Oregon has experienced the disadvantage of growing up in
the shade of her splendid neighbor, California, but has a
solidly prosperous future before her.</p>

<p>It has an area of 95,274 square miles, equal to 60,975,360
acres. The population amounted in 1870 to 90,922, which did
not reach the number required to entitle it to a Member of
Congress according to the fixed ratio. But every State is
entitled to one member, whatever its population may be. By
act of 1866, the States of Oregon, Nevada and California were
constituted the ninth judicial circuit. Oregon forms one judicial
district, and has one collection district, and one port of
entry.</p>

<p>The capital is Salem, where her Legislature meets once in
two years, on the second Monday of September. The State
election is held on the first Monday in June.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="500px;">
<img src="images/state-ks.jpg" width="500" height="235" alt="Illustration of Kansas state seal" />
</div>

<h5>KANSAS.</h5>

<p>1. Nearly every State in the American Union has some
advantage that is peculiar to it, or that it shares in a degree so
eminent as to distinguish it from all others. Kansas is not an
exception, and some of these are exceedingly attractive. They
enter, to some extent, into the painful and bloody history of
its first settlement; the mighty tragedy of the Civil War
having enacted its prelude on her fertile plains. The Kansas
and Nebraska Bill, in 1854, repealed the Missouri Compromise,
and this territory was opened to a trial of strength
between Freedom and Slavery; the contest being transferred
from the floors of Congress and the Representatives of the
people to the settlers of the soil, who were to determine
whether slavery should, or not, exist in it, as a State. The
attraction of a decisive political struggle was added to the
many favorable features of position, climate, and intrinsic
value. Southern people sought to introduce their peculiar
institution, and northern people resisted. There was much
disorder and bloodshed. Every effort was made, by strategy
and force, on the one side and the other. The southern party
was signally defeated and there was henceforth no hope of
preserving to the slave States a balance of power in the
national government, and the civil war followed, almost as a
natural consequence.</p>

<p>2. Kansas is larger by more than 3,000 square miles than
the whole of New England. It lies very near the geographical
centre of the country, and stretches a friendly hand, by the
Pacific Railroads, to both the Atlantic and Pacific States. A
good part of her soil is declared to be much superior to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
of ordinary prairie land in richness, and to average four feet
in depth. It is fairly watered and timbered, and freely produces
everything, except the proper tropical products of the
extreme south, that is grown in the United States. The climate
is that of Virginia, without its excessive heat; which
may, perhaps, be considered balanced by its occasional excessively
sharp and cutting winds in winter. These, however, are
tolerably rare, and the winters, for the most part, short and
mild, the climate being, on the whole very healthy. Its
deposits of salt are exceedingly rich, and other minerals
abound in various parts. Its commercial position is excellent,
and its manufacturing capabilities all that the future will be
likely to require. Its resources, under suitable development,
cannot be considered inferior to any other equal area in the
country; which is speaking in the strongest language we can
command, considering what may be said of so many different
localities.</p>

<p>3. The eastern surface is a succession of waves, or undulations,
the valleys generally extending north and south. A narrow
section west of it, stretching across the State is more level
and the soil lighter. Beyond this long reaches of level, fertile,
and well watered lands are adapted to flocks and herds. These
are much higher than the river beds, the valleys of which
abound in bottoms, beautiful in appearance and situation, and
of inexhaustible fertility. Vast beds of coal, a good quality
and abundant quantity of iron ore, and petroleum and lead
have been discovered. Corn and wheat are the leading staples,
and it is believed that fruit culture will soon become a leading
interest of this promising State.</p>

<p>Kansas was admitted into the Union as a State, Jan. 29,
1861, making the thirty-fourth State. Kansas has an area of
78,841 square miles, equal to 50,187,520 acres. The population
in 1870 was 362,812, giving her three Representatives in
Congress. This State is in the eighth judicial circuit, and
forms one judicial district. It has no ports of entry or
delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>Topeka is the capital. The State election is held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The Legislature
meets on the second Tuesday in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is as follows: “Be it enacted
by the Legislature of the State of Kansas.”</p>

<h5>WEST VIRGINIA.</h5>

<p>This is the only State ever formed, under the Constitution,
by the division of an organized State. The interests of West
Virginia were always different from those of the eastern part;
and when, at the commencement of the Civil War, the eastern
part seceded, the western remained loyal and was erected into
a separate State; thus realizing the ancient wish of its citizens.</p>

<p>The act of Congress organizing it as a State was passed
December 31st, 1862, with condition that it should take effect
60 days after proclamation of its admission by the President
of the United States. This proclamation was issued April
21st, 1863; and it was admitted to representation in Congress
as a sovereign State June 20th thereafter. A temporary government
without representation in Congress had been formed
in May, 1862. It was the thirty-fifth State admitted into the
Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>It is varied in surface, from high mountain ranges, hilly and
undulating midlands, to level and rich river bottoms; and is
nearly all available either for cultivation or grazing; while its
valuable deposits of coal lie very near the surface in nearly all
parts of the State. Iron abounds, and timber of the best
quality. Its manufacturing facilities are great; and its canals
and railroads, with the Ohio river on its northwestern border,
furnish the means of making it one of the richest States in the
Union. The climate is healthy, and the scenery picturesque,
and in places it rises to wild grandeur.</p>

<p>It has an area of 23,000 square miles, or 14,720,000 acres.</p>

<p>The population, in 1870 was 445,616. This State has now
three Members of Congress. West Virginia was subsequently
put into the fourth judicial circuit, and constitutes one judicial
district. Parkersburg, also, was made a port of delivery.</p>

<p>Charleston is the capital. The State election is held on the
fourth Thursday in October. The Legislature meets on the
second Tuesday in January.</p>

</div>

<h5>NEVADA.</h5>

<p>“The Snowy Land” derives its name from the Sierra Nevada,
or Snowy Range of mountains forming the eastern boundary
of California. It lies in the western part of the basin
of the Great Salt Lake and among those mountains, in whose
rocky bosom was found the stimulus that has changed so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
of the Pacific slope, and the Rocky Mountain region, from a
wild and dismal waste to populous and thriving States.</p>

<p>Gold was found in moderate quantities among the mountains,
and population began to scatter slowly over them about 1850,
and soon settlers began to improve the valleys at the foot of
the mountains on the east for agricultural purposes. Carson
county was organized by the territorial government of Utah in
1854; but in June, 1859, rich deposits of silver were found;
and emigration began to pour in rapidly. In March, 1861,
the Territory of Nevada was organized, and the same month,
three years later, it was admitted into the Union, making the
thirty-sixth State.</p>

<p>The history of these States, so rich in precious metals, puts
to the blush the fantastic fables of the Arabian Nights. The
silver mines of Nevada are believed to be the richest in the
world. The celebrated silver mines of Potosi, in South America,
never produced over $10,000,000 a year, while in 1867, one
mine in Nevada produced $17,500,000, and is thought to be
almost, or quite, inexhaustible. The climate, like that of California,
is healthy; the seasons are divided into wet and dry,
and agriculture is dependent on irrigation. With time and
pains its products will be considerable. It has much wild and
sublime scenery, and some natural curiosities; as Lake Mono,
with its waters so sharply acid as to destroy cloth and leather
immersed in it. Its gloomy surroundings, and the great distance
from the tops of the precipitous rocks surrounding its
shores to the surface of the water lend an impressive and fearful
character to its severe desolation. It lies below the reach
of the winds, and no living thing can exist in its waters.</p>

<p>It has an area of 63,473 square miles, or 40,622,720 acres.
The population in 1860, while yet a Territory, was 6,857. In
1870 it had increased to 42,491. In conformity with the Constitutional
provision that every State shall have one Representative
in Congress, Nevada has one. This State lies in the ninth
judicial circuit, and forms one judicial district, called the district
of Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>Carson City is the capital. The State election is held on the
first Tuesday in November; and the Legislature meets on the
first Monday in January.</p>

<p>The enacting clause of the laws is in the following words:
“The people of the State of Nevada, represented in Senate
and Assembly, do enact as follows.”</p>

</div>

<h5>NEBRASKA.</h5>

<p>1. Formed a part of the Louisiana Purchase from the
French government in 1803. It received a Territorial government
in 1854, and was, by the provisions of the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill, equally with Kansas, exposed to the introduction
of slavery; but the Southern people limited their efforts in that
direction to Kansas, and Nebraska did not share in its disorder
and bloodshed.</p>

<p>2. The greater portion of the country consists of a high,
rolling prairie. The soil in the eastern part of the State is
nearly the same as that of the adjoining portions of Iowa and
Kansas. It is a rich loam, finely pulverized, and admirably
adapted to cultivation. The second district, near the center
of the State, is strictly pastoral. The third, or western section,
has a fair soil, but is destitute of timber, and insufficiently
supplied with water.</p>

<p>Throughout the fertile portion of the State, wheat, corn, oats,
and other cereals, and vegetables and fruits yield largely. Vast
herds of buffaloes formerly roamed over its prairies; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
are now mostly exterminated. The altitude of Nebraska secures
to it a dry, pure, and salubrious atmosphere. Rain is not abundant,
but, in the eastern part, is sufficient for the purposes of
the agriculturist. Salt, limestone, and coal are found in various
localities, and not improbably other minerals will be found in
paying quantities. The State is too new to fully estimate all
its resources and capabilities.</p>

<p>3. The educational advantages are good. The Common
School System, modeled on that of Ohio, is well supplied with
funds, embracing one-sixteenth of the public land, or 2,500,000
acres. 90,000 acres were given to endow a State Agricultural
College, and 46,081 acres to the State University.</p>

<p>Its commercial facilities are supplied by the Missouri River,
the Pacific and other railroads, and are amply sufficient to
develop its resources. The future of the State has many elements
of promise. No public debt impedes its growth, and
within the last few years it has increased in wealth and population
more rapidly than any of the adjoining States or Territories.
An unknown, but certainly not limited, amount of
wealth still lies locked up in its soil, and its relation to ocean
commerce by the mighty Missouri, and to inter-State trade by
lying in the great traveled route between the Atlantic and
Pacific States, with a remarkably fine, healthy climate, and the
ease with which its soil is worked, contribute to form a powerful
attraction to labor and capital, and we have no reason to
suspect any decrease in its rapid progress.</p>

<p>4. On its admission, in 1867, it was the thirty-seventh
State. It has an area of 122,007 square miles, or 78,084,480 acres.</p>

<p>Population in 1870, 123,000. It forms the ninth judicial
district, and has no ports of entry or delivery.</p>

<p>The capital is Lincoln. The State election is held on the
second Tuesday in October. The Legislature meets on the
Thursday after the first Monday in January.</p>

<h5>COLORADO</h5>

<p>Was formed from parts of Kansas, Nebraska and Utah. Its
Territorial government was organized by act of Congress,
March 2nd, 1861. It is situated west of Kansas, on the great
route from the Pacific to the Atlantic States, and on the dividing
ridge, or backbone, of the continent. The rivers that find
their head waters within the territory run southeast and south
to the Gulf of Mexico, and southwest to the Gulf of California.
The surface is nearly equally divided between a plain, gently
descending from the abrupt mountain wall of rock constituting
the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains, and the mighty
mass of that chain, with its peaks, rising nearly three miles
above the surface of the sea, now forming an elevated plateau,
and again sending off spurs and lateral ranges containing beautiful
valleys, or, in a more lavish and genial mood, taking a
wide circuit inclosing an immense sunken plain containing
hundreds of square miles of charming, well watered farming
land called parks. Of these there are seven. It is a magnificent
region, and contains all the elements of extreme mineral
and agricultural wealth. It has mines of gold, silver, copper,
lead, and iron. Coal abounds in all parts, oil flows from the
wells with a little encouragement, and salt is easily obtained
in some parts. An immense soda-fountain is found near Colorado
City, called Fontaine qui Bouille (boiling fountain) and
there are indications of cinnabar, platina, and precious stones.</p>

<p>The climate is fine, the general temperature like Southern
Pennsylvania or Maryland; and, from the elevation, the air is
very dry and pure. The plain rises by imperceptible degrees
to 5,000 feet, (about one mile,) above the level of the sea, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
the foot of the mountains. The numerous valleys, the parks,
and much of the sloping plain, form as fine an agricultural
region, with proper irrigation, as any State possesses, and
much of the remainder furnishes excellent pasturage through
the entire year. Occasionally heavy snow falls and for a few
days extreme cold prevails, but these are exceptional years;
and it does not lie long. Its effects can be guarded against
with prudent care. Corn, wheat, and other small grains and
vegetables reach their greatest perfection here.</p>

<p>It furnishes excellent manufacturing facilities along the
unfailing mountain streams in the valleys, and will no doubt
ultimately unite with Montana and Southwestern Dacotah to
supply the immense central part of our domain with all the
products of manufacturing genius and skill.</p>

<p>Denver the capital and principal city, is situated near the
eastern base of the mountains, where these put on their
severest and sublimest aspect. Clear lakes are set like stars,
here and there, and the beautiful and grand in scenery are
nowhere more striking, or more agreeably combined.</p>

<p>The Territory contains 106,475 square miles in area, and the
population in 1870 numbered 29,706.</p>

<p>Several attempts have been made to obtain the admission of
Colorado as a State into the American Union. An act to enable
the people to form a constitution and State Government
was passed by Congress, March, 1864. The constitution,
framed under this act, was rejected by the people of the territory.
Another constitution was framed and adopted in 1865,
but a bill, passed by Congress for its admission, was vetoed by
the President. Another attempt made in 1867 likewise failed
by the President’s veto; since which time it quietly remained
under its Territorial government, until March 3, 1875, when
it was admitted by Act of Congress.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE NATIONAL DOMAIN.</span></h4>

<p>1. When the War of Independence closed, and the people
and government had leisure to look about them and estimate
their situation, they found the organized States covering the
coast from Nova Scotia to Florida, (then in possession of
Spain.) There was no vacant territory near the ocean; but
west of the States—which run back only a few hundred
miles—was a vast region, peopled by a few tribes of Indians
and, in Kentucky and Tennessee, by a few hundred whites.
These with singular hardihood and self reliance, had not hesitated
to brave a thousand perils to get possession of the
charming valleys and fertile savannahs of the eastern part of
the great Mississippi Valley. The settlements were made
near the mountains that skirted the western boundaries of the
original States. Beyond, to the Mississippi river, extended as
beautiful and fertile a territory as any land could boast; many
times larger than the original territory, whose people, poor
and few as they were, had fought for and won it by persistent
bravery. It lay in virgin beauty and wealth, the prize of their
strong hands and courageous hearts. The future of the new
government once determined, and the fundamental Law of the
Land adopted, they prepared to take possession by organizing
a government over those already there, surveying and laying
off the unsettled lands, and bringing them into market for
sale and settlement.</p>

<p>2. The States had owned all the property, and held all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
real power, up to the adoption of the present Constitution. It
was now agreed that the unsettled lands should be considered
as the common property of the whole country, and be administered
by the General Government. It was not without much
difficulty, and many severe contests, that this point was so
settled. There were two parties; one headed by Alexander
Hamilton who wished a strong, consolidated central government;
the other, afraid to confer on it too much power lest it
should prove a tyrannical master, wished to preserve most of
the substance of power in the State governments. They were
led by Thomas Jefferson. The adoption of the Constitution
was difficult, and the struggle over it perilous to the confederation.
It embraced the main views of the first party. But
for the personal influence of Washington, who had presided
over the Convention that framed it, and had, as it were, been
its father, it could not have received the approval of the
majority of the people. The people allowed their fears to be
overruled by their trust in his wisdom and prudence.</p>

<p>He alone it has been believed could have put its machinery
in successful operation; and the admirable manner in which
the statesmen, in Congress and the executive offices, infused
the spirit of freedom and moderation into the administration,
following in the lead of the revered “Father of his Country,”
settled it in the confidence and affections of the people.</p>

<p>3. We have dwelt on this point because it is intimately
related to the organization and government of the Territories,
and to the provision made for the increase of States. It was
important that they should be in harmony with the original
ones, and there were no means of securing this and providing
against the future growth of governments, differing from those
of the original States, but by giving the central power a general
control over them. The Constitution conferred it on
Congress. Ohio, and all the territory north of the Ohio river,
was obliged to wait till this point was settled, before it could
be opened to the entrance of emigrants. This region was
early erected into a separate government, by Congress, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
the Northwest Territory. The region south of the river was
treated in the same manner a little later. In 1800 the Mississippi
Territory was organized; thus covering all the ground
originally belonging to the New Republic. These were, as
population increased, divided into sections, of convenient size
for the purpose of local self government, and states created as
fast as the requisite number of citizens had collected within
such limits; and the remainder continued under the preliminary
territorial rule.</p>

<p>4. In 1802, the vast region west of the Mississippi was
bought of the French government. This extended the National
Domain from the mouth to the head waters of this river, and
westward, north of the Spanish possessions, to the Pacific
ocean. Many new States and Territories have been formed
from it. The process of multiplication has not yet ceased in
this region. In 1819 Florida was purchased; a part of Mexico
was obtained in 1848, and again in 1853; and the increase
of territory continued by the acquisition of Alaska in 1867.
This policy has become, in a manner, traditional, and it is not
unlikely that it may be continued to some extent in the future.</p>

<p>5. The government of the territories is established by act
of Congress; the President nominates and the Senate confirms
the Governor, Secretary, and Judges of the courts; and
Congress passes all the general laws for the government of the
inhabitants. A Territorial Legislature is elected by the
inhabitants, which takes charge of all the local interests of the
Territory. All these laws and organizations are temporary,
and pass away when a State government is founded. Commonly,
an act of Congress authorizes the election of Delegates
to a Convention for framing a State Constitution; though the
Territorial Government sometimes takes the initiative. This
constitution is then submitted to the popular vote of the citizens
in the Territory; and if they favor it, presented to Congress
for its approval. If it is in harmony with our usages,
and republican principles, Congress accepts it, and, if the
President does not see cause to veto it, a new State has come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
into existence. In this manner the number of the States has
become nearly three times as numerous as at the beginning.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LXIX">CHAPTER LXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE INDIVIDUAL TERRITORIES.</span></h4>

<p>The territories are here arranged in the order of seniority,
the one which first received a territorial government taking
the lead. The District of Columbia is older than any of them
as acknowledged National property, the Louisiana Purchase
having been made since it was ceded to the general Government;
but it was the last to receive a territorial organization,
Congress governing it directly without giving it representation
until 1871. It is placed last for that reason.</p>

<h5>NEW MEXICO</h5>

<p>Was visited at an early period by Spaniards, who, excited
by the success of the followers of Cortez and Pizarro in discovering
rich mines of gold and silver, sought the wealth in
the dangers and hardships of travel which is more often, if
more slowly, found as the reward of patient toil. An expedition
from Florida made the formidable overland journey to
New Mexico, in 1537; and another from Mexico, after visiting
the Gila River, passed eastward beyond the Rio Grande in
1540. In 1581 its mineral wealth became known and a mission
was attempted; but no settlement was made until 1600, when
formal possession was taken by an adequate army. The missions
now became very successful and the mines were worked.
Many of the natives were considerably advanced in some of
the arts of civilization. In 1680 the natives revolted, from
the severe servitude to which they were subjected, and drove
the Spaniards out of the country. They only recovered it in
1698. It was never very numerously peopled by whites. In
1846 it was conquered by General Kearney, and in 1848 ceded
to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
difficulties of transportation and the wild and lawless character
of the inhabitants has prevented any extensive emigration
to it by Americans. It is an elevated table-land, nearly
7,000 feet above the surface of the sea, crossed by several
ranges of mountains sometimes rising 10,000 feet above the
general surface of the country. The atmosphere is dry; little
rain falls; and agriculture is usually successful only with irrigation.
In the valleys, where this is employed, the fertility
of the soil is marvelous. Often two crops are raised, on the
same land, in the year. Wheat and other grains are raised in
great perfection. Cotton is successful in some parts, fruit can
be raised in abundance, and the soil is said to be specially
favorable to the grape, the wine rivaling that of France.</p>

<p>Gold and silver abound, but the mines have never been
effectively worked for want of transportation and the requisite
capital. Stock raising is a profitable occupation in this Territory.
Much of the land unfit for cultivation produces grass
which cures in drying during the hot months, and preserves
all its nutritious qualities. Sheep and mules are extensively
raised. When the Pacific railroad shall open the country to
immigration, and order, industry, and capital make the most
of its resources, it will be ranked among the favored parts
of the Union.</p>

<p>It has many natural curiosities, and much wild and beautiful
scenery. The length of the Rio Grande, in its windings
in the Territory, is about 1200 miles; and its valley from one
to twelve miles wide. Its Territorial government was organized
in 1850. The population, in 1870, was 91,878. Many
tribes of Indians roam over the territory and through Texas,
Arizona, and northern Mexico. Most of the people are Roman
Catholics. It includes an area of about 100,000 square miles.
Every free white male inhabitant living in the territory at the
time of its organization had the right of suffrage, that right
being regulated in other respects by its legislative Assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<h5>UTAH</h5>

<p>Was formerly a part of the Mexican territory of Upper California,
and was acquired by the United States in 1848, by the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. It was too distant, desolate,
and dangerous a region for much settlement by Mexicans, and
has little known history anterior to the explorations of Fremont
between 1843 and 1846.</p>

<p>The first American settlement was made by the Mormons,
in July, 1847, and was supposed by them to be out of the territory
of the United States, and beyond the reach of possible
interference. Here, in the depths of the desert, they determined
to build up a peculiar religious society embracing
customs abhorrent to the views and institutions of modern
civilized States. Their success was a surprise to the world, and
probably to themselves; the capacity of the depths of the
Great American Desert, as it was called, for cultivation,
exceeding all previous expectation. But the war with Mexico,
then in progress, threw this, before inaccessible, desert into the
limits of the American Union; and the discovery of gold in
the neighboring territory of California, throwing them almost
midway between the old western settlements and the new Eldorado,
subjected them to contact with, and interference by, the
tide of modern civilization, as it flowed toward the setting
sun; and in ten years from their first appearance in the Great
Central Basin of the continent, they came again into hostile
conflict with the established authorities they thought to have
finally escaped. Though their conflict with the United States
government, imbued with the habits and prejudices with which
they antagonized, was deferred by the troubles which precipitated
the Civil War, and their institutions remained substantially
intact until that was past; the Pacific Railroad was then
built through their territory, and, if they are no longer persecuted,
and their peculiarities opposed by deadly force, the
moral influence and dissolving power introduced by numbers
is more surely wasting away the foundations of their political
and religious edifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span></p>

<p>Utah was organized as a territory by act of Congress Sept.
9th, 1850. Brigham Young, the head of the Mormon church,
became the first governor. In 1854 it was vainly attempted to
remove him; and in 1857 an army was sent to enforce Federal
authority. A final conflict was avoided by compromise. In
1862 the Mormons attempted to get admission into the Union
as a State, with their “peculiar institutions,” but failed. A
Territorial Government exists, but has little force, or vitality,
while the Mormons are large in numbers. According to the
habits of our people, conflict is avoided so far as possible, to
await the more peaceable and natural solution of the difficulty
by moral forces.</p>

<p>Utah is unique in one respect; though lying nearly a mile
above the surface of the sea, and having a complete system of
lakes and rivers, there is no visible connection of these with
the ocean. It is a continent embosomed within the depths of
a continent. The Great Salt Lake is 100 miles long by 50
broad, and its waters are very salt—three parts of the water
producing one of pure salt. No fish can live in it. It receives
the contents of many considerable streams. Whether they are
kept in subjection by evaporation alone, or have a concealed
outlet to the ocean is unknown. The soil, though in its natural
state an apparent desert, is extremely fertile when irrigated,
and produces wheat and other cereals in great profusion.
Its mountains are believed to be rich in silver and gold;
but the Mormons have discouraged mining, and very little has
been done in that direction.</p>

<p>Cotton is highly successful in the southern settlements, and
experiments with flax and silk culture have been very favorable.
The climate is mild and healthy.</p>

<p>Utah is a highly promising section of our national domain.
Its population in 1870 was 86,786; its area about 87,500 square
miles.</p>

<h5>WASHINGTON TERRITORY</h5>

<p>Was organized in 1853, and then contained a much larger
area. It was at first a part of Oregon, and its meagre early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
history was the same. The Straits of San Juan de Fuca were
visited and named by a Spanish navigator in 1775. The English
government claimed the territory north of the Columbia
and for some years there was a joint occupation by both nations
by special agreement. The difficulties concerning this boundary
came near involving the two nations in war, but it was
settled in 1846, giving the United States the territory to the
49th parallel of latitude. Vancouver Island was assigned to
Great Britain.</p>

<p>Washington is estimated to contain, west of the Columbia
river, where it flows down from British America, 22,000 square
miles of arable land. There is much that is adapted only to
grazing, and vast quantities covered with forests in the wild
mountain regions of the eastern part of the territory.</p>

<p>It has an almost inexhaustible supply of coal, and more or
less of the precious metals. The great distinction of Washington
territory is its forests. The warm ocean currents from
the Indian ocean, after traversing the eastern coasts of Asia,
are thrown across the North Pacific against the western shores
of North America, and effect an important modification in the
severity and humidity of the temperature of our Pacific slope.
The climate is much milder and more equable than in the
same latitude east of the mountains, and the moisture is highly
favorable to forest growth. It is the best ship building timber
in the world. The trees are immense, often reaching a height
of 300 feet with a diameter of 8 to 12 feet.</p>

<p>The portion of Washington territory lying west of the Cascade
mountains is rich farming land, heavily timbered; while
east of the Cascades the country is open prairie, well watered,
with small and thinly wooded valleys. The land immediately
about Puget Sound is sandy, not valuable for farming though
producing timber, but a little way back is unrivaled in richness.</p>

<p>Corn does not thrive well, but wheat, oats, potatoes, &amp;c., are
very prolific. Large quantities of butter, cheese, and wool are
produced. There is little snow in the winter and that soon
melts away, except far up in the mountains. Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
shares with Oregon the possession and use of the Columbia
river. There are fine fisheries on the coast and excellent oysters,
and these produce a considerable trade. Immense quantities
of lumber are exported to all parts of the Pacific coast of
both North and South America, and even to Buenos Ayres on
the South Atlantic. The French come here for their best and
cheapest masts and spars. Thus we see that this corner of the
Republic brings to the common stock of national treasures
some of its best and most valuable material of wealth, and is
prepared to whiten the Pacific with the sails of the unlimited
commerce which is already beginning to grow up between us
and the Asiatics. Puget Sound can float with ease the navies
of the world on its peaceful bosom. The Northern Pacific
railroad will originate here, probably, another great commercial
emporium. Washington will, in due time, become a great
and wealthy State.</p>

<p>Its area is about 70,000 square miles; and the population in
1870 was 23,901.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<h5>DACOTAH.</h5>

<p>This territory received an organization and government in
1861. It contains 240,000 square miles; and is greater in
extent than all New England together with the great and
wealthy States of New York and Pennsylvania; and possesses
some peculiar advantages.</p>

<p>The Missouri River passes from southeast to northwest
diagonally through it, navigable for its whole length, a distance
of more than a thousand miles; the Red River of the North
skirts its eastern line, its valley being unrivalled for its richness,
and adaptation to the growth of wheat. Except the
extreme northern part it is said to have the dry, pure, and
healthy climate of Southern Minnesota, with the soil of Central
Illinois.</p>

<p>It is free from the damp, raw, and chilly weather prevailing
in Iowa and Illinois, and from the embarrassments to agriculture
often experienced in these States from excessive spring
rains; while, in late spring and early summer, copious showers
supply sufficient moisture to promote a rapid vegetable growth.
The surface east and north of the Missouri is an undulating
prairie, free from marsh, swamp, and slough, traversed by
many streams and dotted with innumerable lakes, of various
sizes, whose woody and rocky shores and gravel bottoms supply
the purest water, and lend the enchantment of extreme beauty
to the landscape.</p>

<p>It has all the conditions of climate, soil, and transportation,
for the most profitable production of the two great staples of
American agriculture, wheat and corn. West of the Missouri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
the country becomes more rolling, then broken and hilly, until
the lofty chain of the Rocky Mountains is reached. These
mountains cross the southwestern section. A most desirable
stock raising region is furnished here, and mining will flourish
in the mountains. In 1870 it had a population of 14,181.
Yankton is the capital.</p>

<h5>ARIZONA.</h5>

<p>The Spaniards visited the valley of the Colorado at an early
day; but the distance from Mexico, and the warlike character
of the Indians, did not favor settlement beyond what was
gathered about the few missions that were constructed so as
to answer for fortresses.</p>

<p>The part of this territory lying between Sonora, (of which it
formed part,) and California was acquired to the United States
by the Gadsden treaty, made with Mexico Dec. 30th, 1853.
The American government paid $10,000,000 for it. A Territorial
government was organized Feb. 24th, 1863, and embraced
part of New Mexico, containing, altogether, an area of 121,000
square miles, or 77,440,000 acres.</p>

<p>Efforts had been made previously to settle the country and
develop its mines; and an overland mail stage route was
established. This proved a success; but the fierce hostility of
the Apache Indians, and the desperate character of such whites
as had gathered there, fleeing from justice in California and
Sonora, discouraged the immigration of law-abiding citizens;
and the breaking out of the Civil War withdrew the soldiers
in garrison there for the protection of the country. After the
war the main stream of emigration followed the line of the
newly opened Pacific railroad. The development of the mines
required capital and machinery and, though they are thought
to be the richest in the world, nothing could be extracted from
them by individuals without means. So the population has
increased slowly, the census of 1870 giving 9,658.</p>

<p>It is a strange and somewhat fearful land; in great part a
region of desolate mountains and deep canons. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
many sections susceptible of cultivation that would produce
immense returns under irrigation, but most of the efforts in
this direction have miscarried from the desolating ravages of
the Indians. The rainless season reduces the whole country
to the semblance of a desert. It is, however, declared to have
more arable land in proportion to its surface than New Mexico,
or California; and will probably, in time, have a large and
prosperous farming community. Cotton is easily cultivated,
and sugar cane, in the lower parts, produces abundantly.
Grains, vegetables, and melons are produced in the greatest
possible perfection, and mature in an incredibly short space of
time.</p>

<p>When the Apaches are subdued, and society is reduced to
order, it will become a favorite resort of the thrifty farmers of
the older States, and the diligent German and other foreign
immigrants.</p>

<p>It contains many traces of a race that has disappeared; some
of their dwellings yet remaining in a partially ruinous state.
They were probably Aztecs, the race that ruled Mexico before
the conquest by Cortez, or are more ancient still. Hideous
idols are found, and various indications of a barbarous worship.</p>

<p>The completion of the Southern Pacific railway will introduce
the hum of industry among its desolate mountains and
along its numerous fertile valleys, and the acquisition of the
mouth of the Colorado, a large river opening into the head
of the Gulf of California, will give it a profitable commerce.
Arizona lies south of Utah, to which it is superior in the number
and size of its streams, its larger quantity of timber, and
the amount of rain-fall in some parts, which is deemed, in
some sections, sufficient to dispense with the necessity of irrigation.</p>

<h5>IDAHO.</h5>

<p>This territory was organized March 3rd, 1863. It originally
embraced a vast territory lying on both sides of the main chain
of the Rocky Mountains; but the eastern portion has since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
been erected into the territory of Montana. It has about
90,000 square miles of territory, and had, in 1870, 14,998
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Idaho has very little history prior to the organization of its
Territorial government. Its chief attraction to settlers lies in
its mines, as yet, and the population is floating, and, in large
part, rough and sometimes disorderly. The difficulty of reaching
it has prevented its rapid growth. It is exceedingly rich
in the precious metals and this will, in time, attract a large
population. The eastern and northern parts are very mountainous,
abounding in wild and striking scenery and in natural
curiosities. The soil in the southern, central, and western
parts, is fertile, producing wheat and other small grain, and
vegetables very successfully, but is unfavorable for corn from
the late frosts of spring and the early cold of autumn. Snow
falls to a great depth in the mountains; but the streams are
numerous, and there is much choice farming land, which may,
ultimately, serve to support its mining population.</p>

<p>It runs from the northern boundary of Utah to the south
line of British America; Washington Territory and Oregon,
lying west. When railroads shall render it accessible, and open
the way for its treasures to a market, it will be filled with an
industrious and hardy population who will find all the elements
of a prosperity as great as any section of the Union
enjoys. It has three beautiful lakes—the Coeur d’Aline, the
Pen d’Oreille, and the Boatman—of some size, and navigable
for steamers. Boisé City is the capital.</p>

<h5>MONTANA TERRITORY</h5>

<p>Was organized May 26th, 1864. It lies among the Rocky
Mountains, in part on the western slope, but extending into the
eastern valleys; and contains the sources of the streams forming
the Missouri river; while Idaho lies west among the Blue
mountains where the tributaries of the Columbia rise.</p>

<p>Montana abounds in mines of gold and silver; and these are
said to be much richer than those of California. The average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
yield of ores in the latter State is $20 per ton, but the average in
Montana is stated to be four times that amount. Great as is
the yield of gold mines here it is declared that the ease with
which silver is separated from its combinations in the ore will
make that branch of mining more profitable. Copper also
abounds. This territory has several eminent advantages over
other mining districts. It is reached by steamboats on the
Missouri river, from St. Louis, without transhipment: navigation
being free to Ft. Benton, in the heart of Montana. The
river voyage from St. Louis to Ft. Benton, is made in 28 days.</p>

<p>There is a large and constant supply of water, a point of
great difficulty in most of the other mining regions; and the
country everywhere furnishes easy natural roads, the principal
range of the Rocky Mountains not presenting the broken and
rugged character of most other ranges. Associated with this
point is the important fact of great agricultural capability. It
is one of the best grazing regions west of the Mississippi.
Small grain and fruit are grown with the greatest ease, as also
the more important vegetables. There is abundance of timber
for all purposes of home consumption.</p>

<p>The area is stated at 153,800 square miles. The population
in 1870 was 20,594.</p>

<h5>ALASKA TERRITORY</h5>

<p>Was acquired to the United States by treaty with Russia in
the year 1867, for $7,200,000. It is a vast region containing
394,000 square miles, with 24,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>It was first explored by command of Peter the Great of
Russia in 1728. A government was first established on Kodiak
island in 1790. In 1799 the Russian American fur company
was chartered by the Emperor Paul.</p>

<p>The northern portion is a tolerably compact body of mainly
level country about 600 miles square, and a line of coast runs
south for a long distance, including many islands. The Aleutian
group of islands is included. The principal value of the
region to Russia was the fur trade. The annual export of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
amounted to only a few hundred thousand dollars. American
thrift will probably make much more of it.</p>

<p>The country is much warmer than its high latitude would
seem to imply—Sitka in the southern part having about the
same mean temperature, by the thermometer, as Washington!
It is, however, extremely damp. In one year there were counted
only 66 entire days without rain or snow. The coast is broken
with mountains. The peninsula of Alaska has some very high
mountains—Mt. St. Elias and Mt. Fairweather being estimated
at 15,000 to 18,000 feet above the sea. The islands of
the Aleutian group are volcanic in origin. There are several
rivers, the largest, the Yukon, or Kwickpak being 2,000 miles
long, and navigable for 1,500 miles. There are vast supplies
of timber, much being pine, found nowhere else on the Pacific
coast. Vegetables, and some grains, may be raised without
difficulty, and the soil, in parts, is rich. Abundant supplies
of coal are believed to exist. The precious metals and iron, it
is thought, are to be found there, but the country has been very
imperfectly explored.</p>

<p>In the lively and extensive trade that is likely to grow up
with Japan, China, and the East Indies, it will no doubt be
found of great value, and its resources contribute to the wealth
of our country.</p>

<h5>WYOMING TERRITORY</h5>

<p>Was organized by act of Congress July 25th, 1868, and is
the youngest of the territories. Its area is stated at 100,500
square miles, and it had a population, in 1870, of 9,118.</p>

<p>The Pacific railroad passes through it, to which its settlement
is probably mainly due. Montana lies on the north;
Dacotah and Nebraska on the east; Colorado and Utah on the
south, with the northern part of Utah and Idaho on the west.</p>

<p>The main chain of the Rocky Mountains crosses it from
northwest to southeast which maintain here the same general
characteristic as in Montana, viz.: that of a rolling upland.
Its outlying ranges are more broken. Most of the country is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
good arable, or grazing land, sufficiently fertile to give excellent
returns for labor, though, in large part, requiring irrigation.
A few regions are remarkably sterile, but they are
limited in comparison with the fertile lands.</p>

<p>Gold mining has been successful, to a considerable extent;
coal is extremely abundant and accessible; the supplies for the
Pacific railroad being obtained in this territory. Iron has been
found in considerable quantities, together with lead and copper
ores. Oil and salt springs promise to be productive.</p>

<p>Thus without, as yet, developing any eminent specialty, the
resources of this Territory seem to promise all the requisites
of prosperity to a large population; while the climate is mild
and extremely healthy, and the great thoroughfare between the
east and the west furnishes all necessary facilities for transporting
its supplies to the best markets. More intimate knowledge
of its mineral deposits may perhaps give it a higher rank as a
mining State.</p>

<h5>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.</h5>

<p>The first Congress convened under the new Constitution in
1789, held its session in New York. The seat of government
was then removed to Philadelphia. There was much dissension
as to where it should be permanently located. The North
and the South, were each equally obstinate in their desire to
locate it in their own section, and the quarrel threatened a
rupture of the confederacy. The great political question of the
time was the debts of the States contracted in carrying on the
War of Independence. The South, disliking a strong central-government,
opposed giving the charge of the finances
of the country into its hands; while the North, strongly
approved the plan of clothing it with authority to concentrate
the strength of the nation to a reasonable extent, so that it
might be able to act with vigor, and make the country formidable
to its enemies. The reservation of as much power as
possible to the individual States was a vital question with the
South, since it wished to maintain Slavery, and it was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
foreseen that the north must preponderate, ultimately, in the
general government; and the north was unfriendly to slavery.
The Constitution could make its way in the South only by
compromise as to slavery.</p>

<p>The question was a very difficult and delicate one to adjust,
but with much tact Jefferson and Hamilton, usually antagonists
in politics, united to urge a compromise; the North
conceding the location of the national capital, and the South
the assumption, by the general government, of the State debts.
This was accomplished in 1790, and Washington selected the
site on his own Potomac, Virginia and Maryland uniting to
give a tract ten miles square, extending to both sides of the
river. A new city was laid out, and buildings erected which
were occupied for the first time in 1800. This small territory,
the government and control of which was lodged wholly in
Congress, was called “Columbia.” This possession of its own
capital was considered important in order to avoid a possible
conflict of Federal and State authority.</p>

<p>The capital city was located on the Maryland side, and
called Washington. The territory on the Virginia side was,
in 1846, re-ceded to Virginia. On Feb. 21st, 1871, the District
was made a territory, with a legislature for its internal government,
and the right to be represented by one member in
the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The population in 1870 was 131,706. Washington is
adorned with many immense buildings erected for the various
departments of the government, and the capitol itself is one
of the largest in the world, and cost $5,000,000. It is worthy
of the great nation represented in its halls.</p>

<h4 id="II_CHAPTER_LXX">CHAPTER LXX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ANNEXATION POLICY.</span></h4>

<p>1. The original States of the American Union were all on
the Atlantic seaboard. The central States were separated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
the fertile valleys and plains of the Mississippi and its tributaries
by mountains, while those lying at the northern and
southern extreme found, in the vast forests filled with fierce
and hostile savages, a still greater barrier against settlement
westward. The “Old Thirteen” found their hands and thoughts
sufficiently occupied with the establishment of their liberties,
and the ultimate western boundaries of the country were left
to be settled in future years. Fortunately for us England was
too much occupied with the immense debt the useless American
war had cost her to make difficulties over the cession
of the western regions to us; and, at the peace, we were in
possession of the whole region from the Atlantic ocean to the
Mississippi river. That was enough and more for the present;
but the people were enterprising. We offered a home, freedom,
and great opportunities to the oppressed and poor of other
lands, and that region was soon sufficiently peopled to show
what other regions were required to secure the prosperity
of all.</p>

<p>2. It soon became clear that the development of the Western
States east of the Mississippi required the possession of the
lower part of the river and the territory on its western bank.
Circumstances were favorable to its acquisition, and Louisiana,
extending from the mouth of the river far up toward its head
waters, including several hundred thousand square miles of as
valuable land as was to be found on the continent, was purchased.
It entered into the vindictive policy of Napoleon
Bonaparte to injure England by strengthening America, and it
was obtained for the comparatively insignificant sum of fifteen
million dollars. This annexation was altogether essential to
the security and development of the larger part of the original
territory.</p>

<p>3. Florida was discovered and settled by the Spaniards, who
claimed the coast along the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi
river. Though it was not commercially or agriculturally
important to us, it became in the hands of a power not very
friendly, the support and refuge of the barbarous and resolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
hostile Indians of our southern border. It was necessary to
nearly exterminate them to obtain peace, but no absolute security
could be assured while the Spanish territory protected them
in their retreat before our armies. Peace, security against the
Indians, and freedom from the intermeddling of a European
Power required the acquisition of that peninsula and the Gulf
Coast. After twenty years of occasional negotiation it was
purchased for five millions of dollars. This was the most convenient
way, also, of settling an account for spoliations on our
commerce which we held against Spain, and the only means
she then possessed of making payment. Thus another annexation
was made under the pressure of circumstances.</p>

<p>4. By this time a sufficient degree of expansion and strength
had been acquired by the New Nation to inspire in it great
confidence in itself and grand views of its future, and the
“Monroe Doctrine,” that the United States would refrain from
all meddling with the politics of Europe, but would resolutely
oppose the meddling of any European power with the politics
of this continent, was adopted. This doctrine did not propose
any interference with other governments already established
here, but America was to be left to its present possessors, and
European ambition was to look elsewhere for kingdoms to
conquer or found. A tacit protectorate over all America was
assumed, in order to prevent the entrance of any other element
that might build up a system hostile to our interests and progress.
It was a legitimate conclusion from the principles and
necessities that had led to the inauguration of the annexation
policy. The nation claimed that it had a right to keep the
ground clear from obstacles to its natural development. It
was a system of growth and protection involving no ideas of
conquest by force, and no menace to governments already
established.</p>

<p>5. The third addition to our territorial area took place
under circumstances which all true Americans will ever regret.
If stated by our enemies it would be said that, after encouraging
the settlement of the territory of a neighbor by our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
citizens, and giving them covert support in withdrawing that
territory from its proper owners, we took possession of it, and
when they naturally undertook to protect, or recover it, we
made a war of invasion on them, employed our superior skill
and vigor to disarm their State, and took as much more of their
territory as suited our purposes; in short, that we picked a
quarrel, and being the strongest bound and robbed them.</p>

<p>6. It cannot be agreeable to lovers of justice and defenders
of equal rights, that there should be so much of truth in this
statement as to render it impossible to clearly and distinctly
prove the contrary. There was, however, an element of the
necessary and unavoidable, even in this, that was more in harmony
with the previous system of acquisition than appeared
on the surface. Texas presented, perhaps, the finest climate
and the greatest facilities for money-making on the continent.
The Mexicans inherited the religion and hatred of protestants
with the haughty, repelling spirit of the Spaniards, and wished
to preserve the old Spanish policy of separating themselves
from us by a broad barrier of desert and wilderness. They did
not wish to settle Texas themselves, nor feel willing that any
one else should. It is inevitable that enterprise and strength,
impelled by self-interest, will disregard such wishes. Americans
are neither perfect nor magnanimous enough to stand on
ceremony when their interests are concerned. The best that
can be said of them is that they are more moderate and self-contained
than any other people. The necessities of the institution
of slavery required more territory to balance the rapid
increase of free States, and this precipitated the movement
that was inevitable sooner or later from other causes. Indeed
the first patent of territory obtained in Texas, from the Mexican
government, was by a native of Connecticut. The rapid
growth of commerce in the Pacific ocean, the agreeable climate
and fertile soil of California, and the unsettled, wilderness state
of that region, caused the commercial nations of Europe to
look at it with longing eyes. The Monroe doctrine was in
danger of being violated. England had fully prepared to plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
a colony there when it was taken possession of by the American
forces.</p>

<p>7. Thus the enterprise and energy of the nation, which had
still further developed its instinct, or anticipations and plans,
of future greatness, required to use the vast resources of the
Gulf region, and to extend settlements to the Pacific Slope in
order to develop the mineral resources of that region and prepare
to build up its commerce with Eastern Asia. The northern
parts of Mexico were useless to her, since she had neither
population to occupy them, nor strength to subdue the Indians
who roamed over them in scattered bands. There is a justice
and propriety which has the force of Natural Law in allowing
the active and vigorous to take possession of the natural
resources that others can not or will not develop. The earth
was made for mankind as a whole, and what cannot benefit one
race, another, that is able to employ it for its own and the
general good, has some show of right in entering upon. That,
at least, must be the justification of our ancestors in intruding
themselves upon the lands and hunting grounds of the aboriginal
inhabitants of America, and our only excuse for making
war with the Indians, forcing them to part with their lands,
confining them to reservations, and denying to King Philip,
Powhattan, and Tecumseh the admiration and esteem we give
to the patriotic defenders of our native land and natural rights.</p>

<p>8. It is to be regretted that the vast and valuable territory
acquired from Mexico should be the spoil of conquest rather
than the fruit of peaceful negotiation; but the eagerness of the
speculator, the unreasonable pride and selfishness of the Mexican,
and the peculiar requirements of our internal conflict over
slavery put to silence, for a time, the voice of moderation and
equity, and we annexed near 1,000,000 square miles of territory
by force. The payment of $18,500,000, when we might have
taken it without, was an indication that our ordinary sense of
justice was not altogether quenched.</p>

<p>9. We may reasonably consider that this was exceptional,
and that the confusion of judgment and the disorder consequent
on the life and death struggle of the institution of slavery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
which were in a few years to produce the most terrible civil
war known to history, led us into the comparatively moderate
aggression and violence that marked this annexation to our
territorial area. Our traditional policy is to acquire peaceably,
and with a satisfactory remuneration, such territory as the
national progress and development demand. It is contrary to
the spirit of our institutions to oblige the majority of the
inhabitants of any region not within our boundaries to form a
part of the Republic.</p>

<p>10. Two annexations have been made since the Mexican
war. Arizona was obtained by treaty and purchase from Mexico,
in 1854, and Alaska by treaty and purchase from Russia,
in 1867. The first is valuable for its mineral treasures. It
was useless to Mexico, though we gave $10,000,000 for it. It
will ultimately be worth to us hundreds of millions, and its
ruins of an ancient people will be replaced by a thriving population
of intelligent freemen. Alaska is specially valuable in
relation to our future commerce with Asia, and for its fisheries
and fur trade. Its internal resources are, as yet, scarcely known.</p>

<p>11. The superior stability of American institutions and
the love of law and order of the American people may make
annexation desirable and profitable to the more volatile and
unsteady Southern States of America, but it is probable that
no labored efforts to induce annexation will be tolerated by the
mass of the people. We may fairly judge that we have reached
our natural boundaries; that the advancement of neighboring
governments in order and intelligence will suffice to give protection
to the comparatively small numbers who may find a
better field for their energies without than within the Union;
and that if any future annexations are made it will be by the
purchase of uninhabited regions that may be more valuable to
us than to their owners; or that, if any inhabited regions are
incorporated into the Union, it will be at the instance and
desire of its own inhabitants rather than of our people. We
are the special champions of popular and all other rights, and
shall never be likely to forget ourselves again so far as to repeat
the Mexican war, however pressing our desires.</p>

the United States received at the Census Office

<p>As shown in the last census (1870), the seven leading States rank, according to population, as follows: (1) New York; (2) Pennsylvania;
(3) Ohio; (4) Illinois; (5) Missouri; (6) Indiana; (7) Massachusetts. Thus <i>four</i> out of the seven most populous States are “new States;” that
is, they were not included in the original “thirteen.” In 1789, the four States at the head of the list were: (1) Virginia; (2) Pennsylvania; (3)
North Carolina; (4) Massachusetts. At present, Virginia (if the State had not been divided) would have ranked in the seventh place, or next
<i>after</i> Indiana. In absolute increase of inhabitants, Pennsylvania heads the list of the old States in the last decade: and the total population
of said State is about equal to that of the thirteen States of Connecticut, Arkansas, West Virginia, Minnesota, Kansas, Vermont, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Florida, Delaware, Nebraska, Oregon and Nevada. The aggregate population of the six New England States of
Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island falls considerably short of that of Pennsylvania. The States
west of the Mississippi, including the Pacific States, have about <i>one-sixth</i> of the whole population of the United States.</p>

<p>The ratio of increase in population from 1790 to 1800 was 35.02 per cent.; from 1800 to 1810, 36.45 per cent.; from 1810 to 1820, 33.13 per cent.;
from 1820 to 1830, 33.49 per cent.; from 1830 to 1840, 32.67 per cent.; from 1840 to 1850, 38.57 per cent.; from 1850 to 1860, 37.75 per cent.; from
1860 to 1870, 22.34 per cent. Supposing the increase during this decade (since 1870) to be 30 per cent. there would be in 1875 nearly 45,000,000
inhabitants. We have reason to suppose it to be at least 35 per cent. This, in 1880, would give 52,437,192.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT.</span></h2>

<p>1. All government is professedly for the good of the people;
but in point of fact, nearly every government that has ever
been instituted has been in the interest of an individual, a
family, or a class. American statesmen, in forming our government,
admitted the superior rights of no man or class of
men. It was carefully organized to exclude all claims or pretenses
of that kind, with a single exception, at first, which
afterward disappeared in the tempest of a civil war. The executive,
the various members of the government, and the law
makers depend on the people for their elevation. At first they
possessed only the dignity, privileges, and rights of the people
at large, and, their term of office expired, they return to the
same level, honored, indeed, if they have been faithful servants;
if not, carrying to their dishonored graves the reproaches and
contempt of their fellow-citizens, but retaining, in neither case,
a vestige of the power and exaltation over others that clothed
them when in office, the contrary of which so often makes an
unworthy man respectable in a different form of government.</p>

<p>2. That the masses of the people would be able to exercise
a true sovereignty without abusing it was always doubted until
the trial was made in this country. A very respectable class
of statesmen in the early days of the Republic, sympathized in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
this doubt, and it even crept into the Constitution in the form
of electors who were to choose the President; intimating a distrust
of the wisdom and sound discretion of the voters in the
choice of the Chief Magistrate. The liberty allowed to the
Legislatures of the States to determine the manner in which
electors should be chosen, while it recognized State authority
on one side, on the other implied a hesitation to trust so
important a matter directly to the people; and for a long time
they were only indirectly consulted as to the choice of a
President.</p>

<p>3. It was not, however, caused by a desire to keep power
from them, but rather to avoid the unhappy effect of popular
heat and rashness, so often observed in popular governments
before attempted. This distrustful party first took control of
the government, retained it during three presidential terms, and
for many years afterwards formed an influential minority whose
criticisms were of importance in establishing a traditional
policy for the government. This party—the Federalists, headed
by Washington and Hamilton—sought to found a strong and
stable government that should be able to fully protect the
country from foreign interference and domestic discord. Their
control over the administration was somewhat abruptly closed
by acts considered arbitrary, interfering with full freedom of
speech and of the press—the “Sedition Laws” as they were
called. Jefferson and the Republican party demanded the
largest popular freedom, and had the conduct of the government
for twenty-four years, impressing on its habits and policy
the respect for the opinions of the people at large that has ever
since characterized it. The people gradually gained control of
presidential elections and practically set the electors aside,
making and enforcing their own choice in general elections.</p>

<p>4. The exercise of popular sovereignty has gradually been
enlarged, no qualification but that of age and nativity being
now generally required, and the government may fairly be considered
to represent the views of a majority of the people, and
not only of the native, but also of the foreign born; since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
great mass of the latter are, by naturalization, absorbed into
the mass of citizens. They come to make a permanent home
with us, from a preference, as it is fair to assume, for republican
institutions; and it is considered right that they should
have a voice in the conduct of them. Nor have the American
people seen cause to regret their liberality in this respect.
Citizens of foreign birth have usually proved as thoughtful
and wise as the rest of the population, and as worthy of citizenship.
They bring to us wealth in their labor if not in their
purses, and soon become thoroughly American in their habits
and sympathies. The government and the people cordially
welcome them, and find themselves the stronger and richer by
so doing.</p>

<p>5. It must not be forgotten that the strongest fears of popular
influence on the government, the stability of our institutions,
and the maintenance of the good order necessary to the
security of property and the general prosperity, were entertained
at the first; that the prophecies of the foreseers of evil
have been almost uniformly false during its whole course; and
that the relation between the people and the general government
has constantly grown closer, to the great advantage of
both. The first war into which the country was plunged after
the Revolution—that of 1812—was comparatively a failure, in
its earlier part, for want of this mutual confidence. Later the
people and the government have been more closely allied, and
the government has been strong while the people have seen
their cherished ends gained.</p>

<p>There has been continual advance in liberality of administration,
in efficiency of organization, and in the completeness of
social order. We have no reason to suppose that a tendency,
continued through a hundred years and favored by so many
circumstances that are common to all nations in our generation
to a degree never before known, will be changed. Rather we
may confidently expect that with increased intelligence, experience,
and prosperity that tendency will be strengthened.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">SUFFRAGE AND CITIZENSHIP.</span></h3>

<p>1. The right pertaining to citizenship, to vote for such
officers as are elected by the people, is called suffrage. When
that right is acquired with respect to one class of officers it
always extends to the whole, from petty town or city officials,
to high officers of the State and United States government—all,
in short, who obtain office directly from the people.</p>

<p>2. The Constitution defines who shall be regarded as citizens
of the United States, and all such are declared by it to be
also citizens of the State in which they reside. It declares
“all persons, born, or naturalized in the United States, and
subject to its jurisdiction” to be citizens. Indian tribes are
mostly regarded as foreign nations, and have such rights as
treaties give them, but are not taxed and do not vote; therefore
they are not regarded as citizens.</p>

<p>3. Yet suffrage does not belong to <i>all</i> citizens. The special
regulation of the voting prerogative was not assumed by the
Constitution, nor delegated to Congress, and it is generally
conceded that it belongs to the State governments. The regulations
in the States are not uniform, but in no State do women
or minors vote. This cuts off a large part of the citizens,
nearly three-fourths belonging to these classes. Minors are
supposed, however, to be represented, as to their interests, by
their guardians, and females by husbands or brothers. Some
of the States make minor restrictions as to length of residence
in the State, and require a certain amount of property to constitute
a voter, and in some naturalization is not required—so
that the range of the right of suffrage varies within small
limits, in different States. Whatever rule is adopted by the
States has been accepted as the basis of suffrage for that State
by the general government, when members of Congress and
President and Vice-President are voted for.</p>

<p>4. It seems to be a loose point in the regulations, otherwise
so admirable, since it may work a considerable inequality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
under given circumstances; and, in some cases, might change
the policy of the government. It is a question worthy of consideration
whether there should not be an amendment to the
Constitution establishing uniformity of suffrage in all the
States. This point has caused much discussion in the State
governments and various changes have been, from time to
time, made in many of them. These have been, usually, in
the direction of liberality—tending to enlarge the scope of
suffrage. The property qualification, quite common in earlier
times, is now rare. The fifteenth amendment, recently adopted,
has largely increased the number of voters.</p>

<p>5. The experience of the Republic, thus far, has been in
favor of the doctrine that it is safe to trust the people with
their own interests, and that the responsibilities of self-government,
when they are laid on them under the favorable
circumstances that exist among us, tend to improvement
instead of disorganization. Whether this will always be the
case it may not be safe to assume, and a prudent regard to possibilities
should not be neglected; but we should not forget
that those who founded American liberty ran great risks of
anarchy in the eyes of their contemporaries. We ought to be
able safely to continue a policy of suffrage which they introduced
with results so fortunate.</p>

<p>6. Education needs to be encouraged, and this has always
received much attention. It is probable that but for the very
liberal provision made in this respect, the fate of our government
would have been very different. Many foreigners who
had no early education, have been naturalized, and the colored
people born in the country have been made citizens. If the
remainder of the people had not been intelligent, it would no
doubt have been extremely dangerous. It has led to some
serious local interruptions of order and prosperity, but they
have been, so far, temporary; and the general effect has been
to awaken ambition for education; the children of new-made
citizens have enjoyed the same facilities as others to acquire
intelligence necessary to a citizen; and the right of suffrage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
when extended to the ignorant and degraded has seemed to produce
the general effect of destroying a dangerous class by
raising them gradually to intelligence and self-respect and
respect for the laws, by making them the political equals of
those who are socially and intellectually far above them.</p>

<p>7. As we grow in numbers all influences like this take a
wider range, and acquire more power, and sometimes produce
different results, when they become extensive, from what was
the case when more limited, from the difference of influence in
modifying causes; and there has always been fear of trouble
from the extension of suffrage to too many ignorant persons.
It is well to be cautious; but we ought to venture as far as
possible for the sake of improving and elevating all classes of
our people.</p>

<p>8. It is also a question worthy of attention if women who
own property that is taxed ought not to possess the right of
suffrage. The war that made us a Nation was begun because
we refused to be taxed unless we could be represented, and have
a vote in the body laying the taxes. The principle appears to
be precisely the same; and what we fought for then should not
be denied now.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">OUR CITIZENS OF FOREIGN BIRTH.</span></h3>

<p>Whatever fault we may sometimes find with the conduct of
our government; however much self-seeking to the neglect of
the public good there may be among officials; however many
weaknesses, errors, and violations of law may call for our
severest reprobation, and, in moments of depression, lead us to
look gloomily and doubtfully toward the future; yet it is not
to be denied that the Home of real Freedom is with us. Mismanagement
is but temporary, or limited, and easily admits of
remedy, with time and care; our advantages are permanent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
extensive. In eighty years the population has become nearly
twelve times as numerous as at the beginning of that period,
and this rapid growth in numbers has been made up largely
from the disposition of foreigners to make a permanent home
among us. Those who are oppressed, who suffer restraint in
their interests or belief, or wish for a wider career for themselves
or their families—who want a free field for business
enterprise, for mental and moral development, or full play for
their abilities to influence their fellow men, come to us. Here
they find fair opportunity for what may be lacking elsewhere.
They come here by millions; the poor, by industry, become
rich; the oppressed leave persecutions and galling burdens
behind them; and genius finds full play for its aspirations in
whatever direction its energies may be turned.</p>

<p>At the time of the last Census there were 5,566,546 persons
in the Union, and forming part of our population, of foreign
birth. A large part of these have become citizens by Naturalization.
The remainder, or their descendants, if they remain
here, will become citizens by that process, or by lapse of time.</p>

<p>After they have become familiar with our institution, ideas,
and habits, they are incorporated with the body of our citizens
and are a part of the Nation. The naturalized citizen may
become, in time, a State officer, or member of Congress, if he
can make himself acceptable to his fellow citizens; or he may
possibly live to see his son President of the United States.</p>

<p>Congress alone has power, under the Constitution, to enact
naturalization laws. Suffrage, or the right of voting, is left to
the regulation of the States, within certain limits; but every
citizen, made such by law of the General Government, is also
a citizen of the State in which he resides, and will acquire,
within such times as State regulations shall determine, the right
to vote.</p>

<p>State laws regarding suffrage vary. Some States even admit
aliens who are not citizens of the United States to the right
of suffrage and to other privileges; and most require any citizen
to reside a prescribed length of time in the State before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
can vote. A uniform regulation in all the States would be
desirable.</p>

<h4>HOW TO BECOME A CITIZEN.</h4>

<p>Any alien, having arrived in the United States after the age
of eighteen years, may be admitted to the rights of citizenship,
after a declaration, upon his part, or oath or affirmation, before
the Supreme, Superior, District, or Circuit Court of, or any
court of record having common law jurisdiction in, any of the
United States, or of the territories thereto belonging, or before
a Circuit or District Court of the United States, or the Clerk
or Prothonotary of any of the aforesaid courts, two years at
least before his admission, that it is his <i>bona fide</i> intention to
become a citizen of the United States, and to renounce forever
all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, State
or sovereignty whatever, and particularly by name, the prince,
potentate, State, or sovereignty, whereof such alien may at any
time have been a citizen or subject; if such alien has borne any
hereditary title, or been of any of the orders of nobility in the
kingdom or State from which he came, he must, moreover,
expressly renounce his title or order of nobility, in the court in
which his application is made, which renunciation is to be
recorded in such county; and the court admitting such alien
must also be satisfied that he has continuously resided in the
United States for five years, at least, immediately preceding his
naturalization, and also within the State or Territory wherein
such court is at the time held, at least one year immediately
previous to such naturalization; and that during such five years
he has been of good moral character, attached to the principles
of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to
the good order and happiness of the same; the oath of at least
two citizens of the United States is requisite to prove the fact
of such residence; and, at the time of his application to be
admitted to citizenship, he must make, upon oath or affirmation,
the same declaration of renunciation and abjuration of
allegiance to any foreign power, and also make oath or affirmation
to support the Constitution of the United States; all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
which proceedings are to be recorded by the Clerk or Prothonotary
of the proper court.</p>

<p>If any alien, having legally filed his declaration of intention
to become a citizen and taken the necessary oath or affirmation,
die before he is actually naturalized, his widow and children
are entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizens, upon
taking the required oaths or affirmations.</p>

<p>Any alien arriving in the United States under the age of
eighteen years, and continuously residing therein until the time
of his application for citizenship, may, after reaching the age
of twenty-one years, and having been a resident within the
United States for five years, including the three years of his
minority, be admitted a citizen, without making the formal
declaration of intention required in other cases; but at the time
of his admission he must make such declaration, and further
satisfy the court, upon oath or affirmation, that, for the three
years immediately preceding, it had been his <i>bona fide</i> intention
to become such citizen, and in all other respects must
comply with the naturalization laws of the United States.</p>

<p>Severe penalties for counterfeiting any evidence of citizenship,
or disposing of a certificate of naturalization to any person
other than the one for whom it was issued, are imposed by
act of Congress.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">ELECTIONS.</span></h3>

<p>1. A pure democracy is a government in which all the people
who have the proper qualifications for voting personally
take part—or have the right to do so—in the discussion of
public measures, and enactment of the laws. This is not practicable
unless the State consist of a small number of persons;
and a representative democracy is substituted, in which the
masses of the people exercise the voting and ruling prerogative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
by appointing a small number of substitutes to act in their
place and represent them. This appointment of representatives
is for the most part the only direct way in which the
people of this country are able to take part in the government.
Though the theory is that the people alone are sovereign, this
is the only way in which sovereignty can exert itself. Even
if present in a legislative assembly, they cannot discuss or vote
unless they are Representatives, duly elected.</p>

<p>2. Elections, then, are of the highest importance. If a citizen
would exert his sovereign authority, as one of the depositaries
of power, he must take part in them. Representatives
elected to make laws are expected to express the will of the
majority of the people whom they represent. They are pledged,
expressly or tacitly, to do so. If they disobey the will of their
constituents, there is no immediate redress. They can be displaced
only at the close of the term for which they were elected.
There is some inconvenience and danger attending this method;
though the fear of the displeasure of their constituents is
usually sufficient to secure faithfulness. Where the people are
numerous, (there are now more than 135,000 persons to each
representative,) it becomes a matter of much interest to know
what is their will. It is ascertained by the elections. The
people vote for a candidate, or nominee, known to hold certain
political principles. As men do not often see or think alike
there is generally more than one principle, or system of views,
regarding public measures, involved in every election, and
therefore more than one candidate. The result of the vote
shows the will of the majority. The same question generally
occupies the attention of the whole country, and the elections
to Congress determine the policy of the government, so far as
legislation is concerned.</p>

<p>3. The same remarks apply to the election of the President
and the members of the State governments. The choice of
men for the State legislatures determines the policy and political
principles of the State government, and as the majority in
State legislatures appoint the Senators, the character of Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
and its measures are influenced by State elections. The
choice of the President is not, in theory, made directly, since
Electors are chosen, who afterwards vote for the President;
but it is understood that they will vote for a certain man; and
it has been so invariably their custom to do so, that the result
is considered as settled by the direct vote of the people.
Should the Electors do otherwise the people would be very
much surprised and displeased, and those Electors would have
little prospect of appointment to office again. Very few men
in office are willing to seriously offend their constituents, so
that practically, the people vote directly for the President and
Vice-President they prefer.</p>

<p>4. Of all our elections none is considered of so much importance
as the Presidential. These come every four years,
because the Constitution provides that the term for which a
President is chosen, shall be four years. Our elections, both
for the general and State governments, are by ballot, instead
of <i>viva voce</i>, (the living voice,) as in some countries.</p>

<p>The ballot is a small piece of paper, with the name of the
candidate or candidates printed or written upon it, and then
folded in such a manner as to hide them, so that no one but
the voter can tell what names are on his ballot. A vote by
<i>viva voce</i>, is when the voter, in the presence of the inspectors
of the election, audibly and clearly calls out the name of the
candidate for whom he votes, and thus proclaims in the hearing
of all present how he votes. But the ballot enables the voter
to vote secretly if he chooses to do so.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">RATIO OF REPRESENTATION.</span></h3>

<p>1. The ratio of representation simply means the ratio
between the whole population of the United States, and the
whole number of their Representatives in Congress; and this
of course includes the ratio between the people of any individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
State, and the Representatives it is entitled to; both being
estimated upon the same basis, and determined by the same
rule.</p>

<p>2. The distinctive characteristic of our government is, that
it is a <i>popular</i> government. Its power is vested in the people.
They elect their rulers, who are the servants of the people, and
these rulers are expected to carry out the people’s wishes.
Upon such a system, it is a matter of the first importance, to
distribute this power equally among all the people, and after
having fixed upon the ratio between the whole population and
the whole number of Representatives; or, in other words, after
having determined how many members shall compose the
lower House of Congress, the next step is to apportion these
members among all the States in the ratio of their population.
If one State has twice the number of inhabitants that another
has, it will be entitled to twice the number of Representatives
in Congress. If one has ten times the inhabitants that another
has, it will be entitled to ten times the number of Representatives,
and so on; with this one exception, which is, that by a
provision in the Constitution, every State, without regard to
its population, is entitled to one Representative in the lower
House.</p>

<p>3. The adjustment of this matter is all provided for in the
Constitution, that is, in its general features; but it devolves
upon Congress in every tenth year to re-adjust and re-apportion
the Representatives among the several States, according
to the population of each State as shown by the last census,
which is taken every tenth year; and when the apportionment
is once made, it remains the same for the next ten years, when
the census is taken again, and a new apportionment is made.</p>

<p>4. Up to the present time (1874,) this has been done nine
times. It was done the first time by the convention which
formed the Constitution. That apportionment is found in the
Constitution, and is as follows:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>By this it will be seen that the first Congress consisted of
but 65 members.</p>

<p>The Constitution also provided that Representatives should
not exceed one to every 30,000 people. The next year after the
government went into operation, (1790,) the first census was
taken, and as soon as the result was known, a new apportionment
was made. This was done in 1792, and was made upon
the ratio of one Representative to every 33,000 of representative<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
population.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The Representative population includes all free persons, white or black;
to which (according to the provisions of the Constitution), three-fifths of all
the slaves were to be added. But this proviso, now that slavery is abolished,
has become a nullity.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>5. In 1800, the second census was taken; and when Congress
made the apportionment, which was done in 1803, it did
not change the ratio, but left it at one Representative to every
33,000 of the representative population.</p>

<p>In 1810, the third census was taken, and in 1811 the ratio
was fixed at one Representative for every 35,000 of the population.</p>

<p>In 1820, the fourth census was taken, and in 1822 Congress
fixed the ratio at one Representative for every 47,000 of the
population.</p>

<p>In 1830, the fifth census was taken, and in 1832 the ratio
was fixed at one Representative to every 47,000 of the population.</p>

<p>In 1840, the sixth census was taken, and in 1842 Congress
again declared that the ratio should be one Representative to
every 70,000 of the population.</p>

<p>6. In 1850, the seventh census was taken, and in conformity
with the law passed this year, the number of members was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
for the first time limited; the limit being 233; and the Secretary
of the Interior was ordered to take the census returns, and
divide the whole representative population by the number 233,
and to make the quotient the ratio between the Representatives
and the people.</p>

<p>7. We have never seen the result of the Secretary’s estimate,
but, taking the population of 1850 and dividing it by
233, would produce a quotient of nearly 94,000; and this we
take as the ratio, after the time when it was done, 1852; that
is, one Representative to every 94,000 of the population.</p>

<p>8. The eighth census was taken in 1860, and on it an apportionment
was based, which allowed one Representative for
every 127,000 of the population.</p>

<p>In 1850 Congress adopted the principle of permanently fixing
the number of members of Congress, to save the trouble of
doing it as heretofore, every ten years. An act was passed
limiting it to 233; but notwithstanding this limitation, it was
provided that if any new State came in, it should have its
member, which would add to the number. But this increase
was to continue no longer than until the next apportionment,
when the number was to fall back again to the old figure.</p>

<p>In 1862 the law was modified to make the whole number of
members consist of 241 after the 3d of March, 1863. In 1870
the ninth census was taken, and in 1872 Congress decided that
after March 3d, 1873, the Representatives should comprise 292
members, being one Representative for every 135,239 of the
population and apportioned them among the several States as
follows:</p>

<p>9. But it must be borne in mind that Congress has the
power to alter all this, and to enact that Congress shall consist
of any other number of members, although it is not probable
that this will be done soon.</p>

<p>10. The foregoing statements will show the general plan
upon which the House of Representatives is constituted, and
how the several States are constantly changing the number of
their Representatives, and their relative power and influence in
Congress. This can be readily understood by remembering the
fact that new States come into the Union every few years, and
that the population increases much more rapidly in the Western
States than in the Eastern, and that, consequently, the
West is rapidly gaining power in Congress, while the Atlantic
States are losing it.</p>

<p>11. In the apportionment no regard is had to the Territories
or to their population. In this adjustment, the States and
their population only are regarded, and the number of members
is all given to the States. Every Representative from a
Territory is an addition to that number, but it must be remembered
that a Territorial member has no right to vote on any
question, but has only the right to debate; and for this reason
he is not, in the fullest sense, a member, and is not counted in
adjusting the number of which the House is made to consist.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">OATHS AND BONDS.</span></h3>

<p>1. An oath is an appeal to God, by him who makes it, that
what he has said, or what he shall say, is the truth. It is the
most solemn form under which one can assert or pronounce
anything. To utter a falsehood while under oath is perjury, a
crime of the darkest hue. One which God has declared he
will punish, and one which is made infamous, and punishable
by fine and imprisonment by the laws of the land.</p>

<p>2. The Constitution (Art. 6, Sec. 3) requires that Senators
and Representatives, and members of the several State Legislatures,
and all executive and judicial officers, both of the
United States, and of the several States, shall be bound by oath
or affirmation to support the Constitution. Then in the second
article, section eight, the form of the oath required of the
President before he enters upon his duties, is given in these
words:</p>

<p>“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute
the office of President of the United States, and will to
the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution
of the United States.”</p>

<p>3. This is all the Constitution says about oaths; but it is
enough to show that no man (unless he commit perjury,) can
accept office, either under the United States or any State government,
unless he in good faith will support the Constitution.</p>

<p>But in the laws enacted by Congress, we find that not only
official oaths are required; but in a great variety of other cases,
men who transact business with the government are required
to verify their accounts and statements with an oath. This is
particularly the case with those who do business with the custom
house; such as merchants, shipowners, and masters of
vessels. Many oaths must be put in the form of affidavits;
that is, the oath must be written and signed by the deponent,
that the statements made may be preserved.</p>

<p>4. The form of official oaths varies according to the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
of the duties to be performed by the deponent. The oath must
be taken before the officer enters upon his duties. Should he
neglect or refuse to do this, his acts will be illegal, and he
would make himself liable to punishment.</p>

<p>After the late civil war broke out, Congress for the purpose
of preventing those who had voluntarily taken part in the
rebellion, from holding thereafter any office under the government,
passed an act requiring every one before he could accept
any office, either in the civil, military, or naval departments, to
take an oath in the following form:</p>

<p>5. “I, A. B., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never
voluntarily borne arms against the United States, since I have
been a citizen thereof; that I have voluntarily given no aid,
countenance, counsel or encouragement to persons engaged in
armed hostility thereto; that I have neither sought, nor
accepted, nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office
whatever, under any authority or pretended authority in hostility
to the United States; that I have not yielded a voluntary
support to any pretended government, authority, power or
Constitution, within the United States, hostile or inimical
thereto. And I do further swear (or affirm) that to the best of
my knowledge and ability, I will support and defend the Constitution
of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same;
that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully
discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.
So help me God.”</p>

<p>So strong and comprehensive an oath as this was never before
required from any officer of the government. It answers the
requirements of the Constitution, and substantially comprehends
all contained in any other forms heretofore used. It is
at once an oath of allegiance, an oath of support of the Constitution,
and an oath to discharge faithfully the duties of the
office taken. This goes by the name of the <span class="smcap">Test</span> oath, and
frequently “The Iron-clad Oath.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>6. The object of the test oath was, during the Civil War,
to prevent the entrance into any office of a person who might
be secretly unfriendly to the government, and use his position
to the advantage of its enemies. So comprehensive and minute
an oath would allow no chance of mental evasion to a conscientious
person, and would lay the offender under the liability
of severe punishment. It is evidently proper to bind all officers
of the general and State governments under the strongest
and most solemn obligation to a faithful and honest discharge
of their duties.</p>

<p>7. Whoever receives an office in the United States, which
is connected with the revenue in any way, so that public money
passes through his hands, is required to give a bond as security
for such money. These bonds give the government a claim
on their property if the money is not accounted for according
to the directions of the law. They are signed by one or more
persons who must show that they have the means to pay the
amount for which they become security. The amount of security
required depends on the sums of money that are to pass
through the hands of the official, or which is likely at any time to
accumulate in his possession. The government takes all the care
it can that there shall be no risk of loss of the public property,
and the bond is designed to afford adequate security for all that
any officer may have charge of.</p>

<p>8. By this means two important ends are gained. No person
can get an office who has no friends and no reputation for
uprightness sufficient to induce those that know him to risk
their own property on his honesty and faithfulness. It was
designed to be a sure means for the government of finding out
who were to be trusted. If he has not property himself, so
that he can secure his bondsmen to their satisfaction, he must
have so high a character for integrity that they are willing to
risk their money in his hands, or he cannot obtain an office.
Security for public funds, and a high degree of personal worth
are both expected to be gained by this requirement.</p>

<p>On the whole, this works very well indeed, in both respects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
but there seems no security, that is quite infallible, against
roguery, unless it be in the extreme care of the people, and their
constant watchfulness over all the affairs of the country and all
the men who represent them. It is difficult to make a house
so strong that a thief cannot get into it by force or stratagem,
and rogues who wish to steal from the public funds may band
together and help one another to get into office and then divide
what spoil they can secure; or unforeseen events may bring
more money than was properly secured into an officer’s hands,
or those whose duty it is to see that he disburses the funds at
the right times may be careless or dishonest.</p>

<p>9. The only sure way is to take care that none but men of
proved integrity get into office, and to take all pains to cultivate
honesty in the community at large. The money lost by the
government is probably much less in proportion than in the
private business of the country. Great watchfulness is really
exercised, and when such a case occurs it is immediately known
through the whole country. Not many men are willing to run
so much risk of punishment and public reprobation. Too
much care, however, cannot be taken to prevent corruption in
public life. It destroys the purity and soundness of <i>character</i>
on which our institutions are founded. A republic cannot
exist without a high standard of virtue.</p>

<p>10. Every official is required to take an oath, or make a solemn
affirmation to discharge the duties of his office faithfully.
Though we cannot expect to be quite secure against the trickery
and insincerity of false and corrupt men, yet we have
reason, on the whole, to congratulate ourselves on the general
security of public property, and the watchfulness of the people
over their servants in places of trust.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">GOVERNMENT PRISONS.</span></h3>

<p>1. The United States government has always endeavored to
continue, as it commenced, to rule with vigor, and to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
a wholesome respect for its own authority and the rights of all
its citizens, while it has, beyond all other governments, probably,
that have ever existed sought to avoid arbitrariness and
severity; keeping in mind the principle lying at the foundation
of its institutions that it exists, not for itself, but for the
good of the people. It has assumed that the people generally
would not require coercion to submit to its regulations, and
has not, therefore, made that ample provision for punishment
and intimidation that is usual among governments.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this we call attention to the fact that the
general government does not own, and has never built, prisons
for the confinement of offenders against its laws. Imprisonment,
as the mildest form of punishment, has, indeed, very often
been inflicted, more often than any other form of punishment.
How does this occur when they own no prisons? The answer
is that they use the prisons of the States wherever they will
allow it. This arrangement between the general and State
governments has been made in nearly if not all the States; the
United States paying for the support of their prisoners.</p>

<p>2. But in case any State should refuse to make such an
agreement, the United States marshal of any district where a
prisoner is to be confined, is authorized to procure some building
where the prisoners may be safely confined in the district
where they have been tried and convicted, or where they have
been arrested and are held for trial.</p>

<p>This is a far more economical plan than it would be for the
United States to build prisons all over the country, and then to
employ keepers of them. It exemplifies the friendly relations
existing between the States and the general government.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">PROCLAMATIONS.</span></h3>

<p>1. A Proclamation is an official notice published by one
high in authority, for the purpose of giving reliable and authoritative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
information to the people that something has been done,
or will soon be done, which is important for them to know,
that they may act, or refrain from acting according to the
information contained in the proclamation. These proclamations
are made known to the country through the most extensive
channels of information that can be used for conveying
intelligence to everybody in the Republic. In our day, and in
our country, the newspapers are the best means that can be
used for this purpose. But in ancient times, and before the
art of printing was known, swift riders or runners were dispatched
to every part of the kingdom or country over which
the proclamation was to be made known. These messengers
carried it with them, and proclaimed it in the ears of all the
people.</p>

<p>2. These documents are official acts brought before the
people in due form and solemnity. Sometimes they are only
recommendations; at others they have all the force of organic
law, or the acts of Congress.</p>

<p>It has, for some years, been the custom of the Executive
to designate some day toward the close of the year as a day
of thanksgiving, recommending the day to be observed in a
religious manner. Important changes in the commercial
affairs between us and some foreign country are made known
by the same method.</p>

<p>3. A memorable proclamation was made by President
Lincoln, in 1862, by which he made known to the country, and
especially to the Southern States, that if they continued their
war against the United States for one hundred days after its
issuance, he would then, in virtue of his authority as commander-in-chief
of the army and navy, liberate the slaves in
all the seceded States. At the expiration of the time, which
was on the first of January, 1863, he issued another proclamation,
in and by which he did emancipate all the slaves in every
State which had warred against the United States government.</p>

<p>The blockading of our ports at the commencement of the
civil war, and the imposition of an embargo upon our shipping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
previous to the last war with England, were both subjects
which brought out proclamations from the President who then
filled the Executive chair.</p>

<p>4. The above examples show the character of the cases which
cause proclamations to be issued. In some instances they have
the authority of law; in others they are merely recommendations;
and in others only communicate important intelligence
in regard to our public affairs at home or abroad.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">COMMISSIONERS.</span></h3>

<p>1. As it is one purpose of this work to give a clear and
complete account of the mode of conducting the affairs of the
general government, we have thought it best to call attention
to the class of officers named at the head of this chapter; and
especially since persons acting under this title are assigned to
a variety of duties, sometimes permanent and sometimes
temporary. In the first place, they act as heads of bureaus in
the various departments. These commissioners are permanent
officials of the government, established and provided for by
law; such are the commissioners of the land office, patent
office, pension office, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Another class of commissioners can hardly be considered
officers, but rather temporary or special agents. In the multifarious
duties devolving upon Congress, the President, and all
the departments, it not unfrequently happens that it is impracticable
for them to do certain things necessary to be done.
The business to be transacted may be at a great distance from
the capital, even in a foreign country. In these cases commissioners
are appointed to do such business. They have
been appointed to negotiate a peace, to make treaties of various
kinds between us and other powers, and to negotiate with the
Indians for the purchase of their lands. The United States
courts appoint them to take bail, or to take testimony to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
used on trials, and do various other things necessary in trials
and proceedings before them.</p>

<p>3. Congress frequently appoints commissioners to obtain
information, or to investigate some matter on which they
expect to legislate. In all cases they must report their proceedings,
either to Congress, to the President, or to the head
of the department under whose instruction they act. Permanent
commissioners report once a year, or oftener if required,
that Congress may know the condition of affairs in their
respective bureaus. Special commissioners, after they have
performed the work assigned, make their report; after which
their duties cease, and their commission comes to an end.</p>

<p>4. The lowest grade of diplomatic agents are called commissioners.
We are thus represented at the present time in
the Republics of Hayti and Liberia.</p>

<p>5. By recent acts of Congress, the powers of commissioners
in some cases have been enlarged. They now examine
persons charged with crimes against the laws of the United
States; hold them to bail, discharge them, or commit them to
prison; and do other magisterial acts, preliminary to the trial
of the accused. When acting in such cases, they are clothed
with some of the powers of a court.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">OFFICIAL REGISTER.</span></h3>

<p>1. Congress, in 1816, passed an act authorizing and requiring
the Secretary of State, once in two years, to print and
publish a book called “the official register,” in which he was
ordered to register the name of every officer and agent of the
government, in the civil, military and naval departments,
including cadets and midshipmen, together with the compensation
received by each; the names of the State and county
where born; and the name of the place where employed,
whether at home or abroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span></p>

<p>To the list of persons employed in the Navy Department,
the Secretary of the Navy is required to subjoin the names,
force and condition of all the ships and vessels belonging to the
United States, and when and where built.</p>

<p>This work has been published and distributed, as the law
directs, ever since the passage of the act, and is sometimes
denominated “the blue book.” It is a very convenient and
useful publication, as it shows in compact form the whole official
force of the government in each department, together with
the cost of maintaining it.</p>

<p>As it contains only names and dates and facts relating to
persons, comparatively few would take the pains to read it,
and but a small number is published. It can be found in
the Congressional library at Washington, where twenty-five
copies of each edition are deposited.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE STARS AND STRIPES.</span></h3>

<p>A nation’s Flag represents its sovereignty. It is adopted
by its supreme authority as a symbol or sign of itself, and
wherever it waves the fact of the substantial control of that
authority, at that point, is thereby asserted. If there is a
struggle between two powers for control, the presence of the
flag proves that the authority it represents still maintains
itself, and its subjugation is declared by lowering its flag and
by the substitution of another in its place.</p>

<p>The flag is, therefore, an expression to the eye of the condition
of things; and attracts the sympathies and antipathies,
the joys and sorrows, the hopes and fears of those interested in
the sovereignty it represents. It is the rallying point of sentiment
and of energy. The affection and reverence bestowed
on our country will light up into a patriotic flame at sight of
its flag. It is associated with all the heroic deeds and achievements
that adorn our national history, and with the loss of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
those we honored and loved who followed and fought for it, and
gave their lives in its defense. Our “Star Spangled Banner”
has been a thousand times baptized in blood dearer to us than
our own, and the sight of it recalls all these sacrifices so cheerfully
made to establish or to preserve our institutions. The
flag of the United States may well call forth more enthusiastic
affection, pride, and hope than any other in the world; for it
symbolizes not only home, country, and associations dear to
Americans, but the justice, liberty, and right of self government
that are dear to all mankind. Humanity at large has a
deep interest in it.</p>

<p>Its history is this: Soon after the Declaration of Independence
the Continental Congress appointed a committee to confer
with Gen. Washington and “design a suitable flag for the
nation.” After the painful and depressing defeat on Long
Island, the retreat through the Jerseys and across the Delaware,
when everything seemed lost for the new government,
Washington suddenly struck the vigorous blows at Trenton
and Princeton that confounded the enemy and drove him back
to Staten Island. Congress and the country were cheered with
a hope and a resolution that never afterwards failed them; for
in the next campaign occurred the capture of Burgoyne, followed
by the treaty with France; and the close of the war in
our favor was henceforth only a question of time.</p>

<p>In the month of May or early June, 1777, following the staggering
blow Washington had given the British army in Jersey,
the committee referred to above, and Washington, completed
the design for a flag. This was accomplished and the
first flag made at the house of a Mrs. Ross, in Arch St., Philadelphia.
The house is still standing—No. 239. She had a
shop where she followed the “upholder” trade, as it was then
called—the same as our upholstering. One day the Commander-in-chief,
Hon. Geo. Ross, a relative of hers, and certain
members of Congress, called on her, with a design for a flag—thirteen
red and white stripes, alternate with thirteen six
pointed stars—and requested her to make the flag. She consented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
but suggested that the stars would be more symmetrical
and more pleasing to the eye if made with five points, and
folded a sheet of paper and produced the pattern by a single
cut. This was approved and she finished a flag the next day.
Mrs. Ross was given the position of manufacturer of flags for
the government, which descended to her children.</p>

<p>This was the flag that led our armies to victory during the
remainder of the war, waved over the crestfallen soldiers of
Burgoyne and Cornwallis, and at the mast head of John Paul
Jones on the English coast. In 1794 this flag was changed,
though its chief features were retained. Congress then ordered
that the flag should consist of fifteen stripes, alternate red and
white, and fifteen stars, white on a blue field. There were
then fifteen States. The stars and stripes were equal, and a
stripe and a star were added with the advent of each new State.
This was changed in 1818, as the States increased and the flag
threatened to become too large, by reducing the stripes to thirteen,
representing the original Union, and the stars were made
equal to the number of States. No change has since been
made except to add a star whenever the union increased by the
admission of a State.</p>

<p>“The Star Spangled Banner,” a stirring patriotic song which
is to Americans what the “Marseillaise” is to the French,
was composed by the author during the cannonade of Fort
McHenry, near Baltimore, by the British fleet co-operating
with an army which was to attack it, simultaneously with the
fall of the fort, by land, Sept. 13th, 1814. The poet had gone
on board the fleet under a flag of truce before the attack began,
to negotiate about some prisoners, and was obliged to remain
until the next day, the cannonade continuing during the night.
If the fort surrendered Baltimore would be taken; and the fate
of Washington, pillaged and burned a few days before, filled
the people with the anxiety which is expressed by the poet, to
know if the flag still waved in the morning “over the Land of
the Free and the Home of the Brave.” The joy of all America
may be conceived when Admiral Cockrane drew off his fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
and took the British army on board, while the “Stars and
Stripes” continued to float gaily on the breeze over Fort
McHenry.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES.</span></h3>

<p>1. The use of seals to give authority to documents, and to
establish their genuineness, comes down to us from a remote
antiquity. It is much easier to counterfeit a signature alone,
than the impression of a seal, and when both occur on a document
it is considered fairly safe to be relied on as a sign of
authority.</p>

<p>They are usually emblematic of some event, or sentiment
attaching to the history or prevailing tendency and feeling of
a country. They are used on documents or papers issued by
the government. Some of the Departments have a special seal
for their own use, in cases where the signature of the President
is not required. If it is not affixed to the proper papers
they fail to become legal and have no authority.</p>

<p>2. The usual mode of affixing the seal formerly was by
placing melted wax on the paper and pressing the seal on it
giving a fac simile or perfect representation of it. As this
required time and business increased with the growth of the
country, Congress passed an act making it lawful to affix the
seal by making the impression directly on paper.</p>

<p>The custody of the Great Seal is with the Secretary of State,
whose duty it is to affix it to all civil commissions issued to
officers of the United States appointed by the President and
Senate, or by the President alone. But it is forbidden to be
affixed before the President has signed it. The seal alone
without the signature has no value. It is used to show the
genuineness of the President’s signature.</p>

<p>3. The Secretary of State and all the other secretaries of the
great departments, each have a seal of office which is affixed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
commissions, and to other instruments emanating from their
respective offices.</p>

<p>Several of the most important bureaus are required by law
to have seals of office; for example, the Land Office and the
Patent Office. When the United States gives a patent (title)
to land, it must be sealed by the Land Office seal. A patent
right must be issued under the seal of the Patent Office.</p>

<p>4. One of the most common and important uses of seals
arises from the necessity people are often under to have copies
of records, maps, and various other papers, the originals of
which are in some of the departments at Washington, to be
used as evidence in courts, where trials and other legal proceedings
are pending. In order to provide for this necessity, Congress
has enacted that copies of such records, maps and papers
belonging to any of the government offices, under the signature
of the head of such office, or of its chief clerk, with the
seal affixed, shall be as competent evidence in all cases as their
originals would be.</p>

<h4>HISTORY OF THE GREAT SEAL.</h4>

<p>1. Soon after the formal establishment of the Republic by
the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin, John
Adams, and Thomas Jefferson were appointed a committee to
prepare a seal. They employed an artist and furnished various
devices; Jefferson combining them all at the request of the
others. The paper still exists in the office of the Secretary of
State at Washington. They reported Aug. 10th, 1776, but for
some unknown reason, probably neglect, it was not acted on.</p>

<p>In 1779 another committee was appointed, to make a device.
They reported May 10th, 1780. It was not acceptable, and was
recommitted, being again reported a year afterwards, but not
adopted. In 1782 a third committee was appointed, but could
not satisfy Congress in their report. It was then referred to
the Secretary of Congress, Charles Thomson, who procured
various devices that were unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>After vainly striving to perfect a seal which should meet the
approval of Congress, Thomson finally received from John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
Adams, then in London, an exceedingly simple and appropriate
device, suggested by Sir John Prestwitch, a baronet of the
West of England, who was a warm friend of America, and an
accomplished antiquarian. It consisted of an escutcheon bearing
thirteen perpendicular stripes, white and red, with the
chief blue, and spangled with thirteen stars; and, to give it
greater consequence, he proposed to place it on the breast of
an American eagle, displayed, without supporters, as emblematic
of self-reliance. It met with general approbation, in and
out of Congress, and was adopted in June, 1782; so it is manifest,
although the fact is not extensively known, that we are
indebted for our national arms to a titled aristocrat of the
country with which we were then at war. Eschewing all heraldic
technicalities, it may be thus described in plain English:
Thirteen perpendicular pieces, white and red; a blue field; the
escutcheon on the breast of the American eagle displayed, holding
in his right talon an olive-branch, and in his left a bundle
of thirteen arrows, and in his beak a scroll, inscribed with the
motto <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>. For the crest, over the head of
the eagle, which appears above the escutcheon, a golden glory
breaking through a cloud, and surrounding thirteen stars,
forming a constellation of white stars on a blue field.</p>

<p><i>Reverse.</i>—A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith, an eye in
a triangle, surrounded with a glory. Over the eye, the words
<i>Annuit Cœptis</i>—“God has favored the undertaking.” On
the base of the pyramid, are the numeral Roman letters
MDCCLXXVI; and underneath the motto, <i>Novus Ordo
Seculorum</i>—“A New Series of Ages”—denoting that a new
order of things had commenced in the Western hemisphere.
Thus, after many fruitless efforts, for nearly six years, a very
simple seal was adopted, and yet remains the arms of the
United States.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORIGIN OF LAW.</span></h3>

<p>1. The origin of law varies with the character or class of
the government under which it is made. Where all authority
is concentrated in the hands of one man his will becomes law
whenever expressed, or when expressed in some regular and
formal way. More generally laws are originated, in our days,
in civilized countries where there is a monarchial government,
by the ruler in conjunction with representatives of the people
or some classes of them. In point of fact, rulers are always
obliged to regard the habits, traditions, and feelings of the
people more or less, or they may be obliged by a revolution, or
the intrigues of the ambitious founded on their discontent, to
retire to private life. The real prominence of the people in
their governments is constantly becoming greater in all civilized
lands, and it seems highly probable that, before many
generations have passed, all governments not founded on an
acknowledgment of the Sovereignty of the People will be
incapable of maintaining themselves.</p>

<p>2. In the United States of America the source of all
authority, and the origin of all law, is in the people alone.
The fact that laws are made by Representatives does not alter
the principle at all. They are simply the substitutes or agents
of the people. Where there are many people any other than
a Representative Democracy is impossible. These are chosen
from among their equals, and when their term of office has
expired return to the common level. If they are ambitious
of more than one term of office they must take special care
not to offend the majority that first elected them.</p>

<p>3. The first signal exercise of the law making power by the
people was in the adoption of the Constitution as the Fundamental
Law. This established the character of the government,
prescribed the duties and limits of the legislative and
executive branches, and organized a third branch to watch
over the action of the other two and keep it in harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
the Constitution. This Instrument then became the source or
foundation of all <i>special law</i>. It is a comprehensive statement
of the will of the people, but it may be changed or
enlarged in a prescribed way. It is binding on all legislators
and executives. Whatever may be enacted or done by them
not in accord with it is null and void; the Supreme Court
being bound so to announce when the fact shall be proved
before it. The Constitution is the Law of the Land. Any
laws enacted by Congress, or by State Legislatures, not contrary
to it, are valid and binding; but any attempt to set aside
any of its provisions, or disregard its true intent, would be
usurpation and a violation of the rights of the people. The
term State Sovereignty can, consequently, be true only in a
limited and secondary sense, this being a higher Sovereignty
still.</p>

<p>4. The larger part of the general laws by which we are governed
are made by Congress, that body having been instituted
to that special end. It is composed of a popular House, or
one chosen directly by the people, and one more select, chosen
by the State Legislatures to represent their States as a whole.
If the Legislature represents the will of the people of the
State accurately, as it always does unless some change in popular
opinion takes place suddenly after it has been elected, the
Senators as well as Representatives will embody the views of
the people in their respective States. So we see that the people
are Sovereign and law really originates with them. Laws,
indeed, may be made by their agents that do not suit them;
but, if they cannot induce them to repeal such laws by petition,
remonstrance, or otherwise, at once, by waiting a little
until the terms of such members expire they can replace them
by others pledged to carry out their views. Thus the general
policy of the government is determined by the people at the
general elections. They give the law to the law makers, and
appoint the executives who will administer them in the spirit
they approve. The whole matter is within their control as a
point of power, and still more so from the natural deference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
the Representatives of the people feel toward the wishes of
those on whose favor they depend. The deep indignation or
contempt of their fellow men will seldom be incurred, even if
they have no ambition for further electoral honors.</p>

<p>5. The treaties made by the President, which require to be
ratified by the Senate to become binding, and the approval of
the House of Representatives if money is required to carry
them into effect—since only that branch can dispose of the
property of the country, or originate laws for raising money—have
also the force of general laws. The whole country is
bound to act in conformity with their provisions. We have,
then, three kinds of law, or laws from three different sources
that are alike binding on the whole country: the Constitution,
which is unchangeable except by vote of the Legislatures or
conventions of three-fourths of the States; the laws of Congress,
which may be made and repealed at their pleasure; and
treaty law, which involves the consent of a foreign State, but
requires the assent of the President and one or both bodies of
Congress, and which may be abrogated or modified at the
united pleasure of all the parties concerned in making it.</p>

<p>6. There is a fourth species of law more general still and
more or less of which is often involved in treaties with foreign
governments. This is the Law of Nations, or the principles
acknowledged by all civilized nations as binding on them in
their intercourse with each other. The only binding force it
possesses is in the general practice of mankind, and the
authority of public opinion. This is commonly effective, since
all law depends really on the approval of the people for its
efficacy, or at least on their silent submission if they disapprove.</p>

<p>7. In every State in the Union the people elect a Legislative
body which makes such local laws as the people wish to
be governed by, and as their special circumstances require;
but they are not permitted to legislate on general questions,
to make any law contrary to the Constitution, or to the laws
of Congress, nor are its laws binding on any but the citizens
of the State in which they are made, or such others as may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
residing there. Each State has a Constitution which determines
the special organization of its government, and limits
and defines the powers of its different branches; but it is
required to be in harmony with the Constitution of the United
States. The Constitution, Legislature and officers of a State
are determined by vote of its people.</p>

<p>8. After this examination we reach this conclusion: That
there is no institution in the United States that has not been
virtually established by the people, its fundamental law was
adopted by them of their own free will and may be changed
when they see fit; and that if all the laws, of whatever kind,
that are binding on them, are not such as they prefer, they are,
at least, originally responsible for them, and have in their
hands the means of changing them within a reasonably short
period. In fact their demand or the zeal of their Representatives
for their interests usually originates whatever laws are
made. The constant general prosperity of the country since
the establishment of the present government, the increase of
intelligence and self respect among the people, and the beneficial
influence exerted by the United States on the world tend
to confirm and settle its principles and laws on a permanent
foundation.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LAW OF NATIONS.</span></h3>

<p>1. The laws of any nation are the rules by which it is governed,
a violation of which renders the offender liable to the
infliction of certain penalties. These laws, in many nations,
are carefully and systematically arranged in the beginning, as
in the United States; in others, as in England, they are gradually
produced, the course taken in dealing with the first of a
class of similar cases furnishing a precedent that is equal in
force to a general law.</p>

<p>2. From very early times the different nations who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
intercourse with each other began to follow certain rules, which
commonly originated in the mode last mentioned above; and
many of them became generally recognized as the proper guide
in international intercourse. These customs came, at length,
to be called the Law of Nations. Writers of eminence carefully
investigated them, and studied the principles on which
they were founded. These writers are held to be authorities
as to this law, and the principles they have laid down are generally
acknowledged, by civilized nations in modern times, as
the standard of International Law.</p>

<p>3. There is no possibility, in the present state of the world,
of organizing a tribunal with authority to impose penalties for
violations of this law by individual nations; though it is to be
hoped that may some time be the case. The only representative
of such a tribunal is the general opinion of the civilized
world; and nations must, themselves, act as supreme judges
and executors of the law as it applies (or as they choose to hold
it as applying) to their disputes. When they cannot come to
an agreement with their adversaries, they commonly Declare
War, and endeavor to right themselves by force.</p>

<p>4. This is not, by any means, an equitable or satisfactory
way of avenging wrongs. The aggressor may be the strongest;
and the offense, in that case, will be greatly increased. It
causes the penalty, in any case, to fall very heavily on many
innocent heads, and produces lamentable and wide-spread desolation.
Yet it is sometimes better than tame submission; and
the right to make war when grievous wrong has been suffered,
or indignity offered to the national honor, is recognized by the
Law of Nations; and certain rules are applied by it as a guide
in honorable warfare. There is nothing but self-respect, and
respect for the opinions of the civilized world, to keep belligerent
nations within the limits of these rules. They are, however,
continually becoming better defined, and Public Opinion
has more and more weight in each succeeding generation.</p>

<p>5. Some of the more important features of International
Law (or the Law of Nations) are, that every nation has the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
to regulate her own internal affairs without interference from
others, unless some of these regulations may seriously affect
the interests of a foreign power; that national boundaries are
to be respected; that bodies of water lying within a national
territory, and the seacoast for three miles from the shore, are
under its exclusive jurisdiction; and that a nation may take
measures to protect its own citizens who may be traveling or
doing business in other countries, unless they violate its laws;
and then it may first examine the case before the accused is
given up for trial and punishment to a foreign court. There
are many other rules. These will serve as examples.</p>

<p>6. One class of these laws requires special mention, because
they are often more carefully defined than most other international
customs. These are Neutrality Laws. Those now in
force in the United States were enacted in 1818. They are only
a formal recognition by our highest legislative authority—Congress—of
the Law of Nations as generally accepted by other
governments. The leading regulations are, that our citizens
shall not interfere, but at their own risk and peril, in contests
between other nations; that no armament shall be fitted out in
our territory for the purpose of making war on any power with
which we are at peace; and making it unlawful for an American
vessel to carry “Contraband of War” (or war material) to
either of two warring nations. It forbids granting to one
nation rights not allowed to the other with which it is at war.
Neutrality Laws are designed to avoid causes of unfriendly
feeling, and to prevent the improper interference of our citizens
in the quarrels of other nations.</p>

<p>7. Our government believed itself wronged in the course
of the recent Civil War by England. It claimed that the English
government had not been at proper pains to preserve a
neutral attitude; and complaint being made, the two governments
agreed to appoint a Commission to examine and arbitrate
the case—the decision, whatever it might be, to be accepted
by both parties. This was done, at Geneva, in Switzerland;
and probably prevented a war between the two countries. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
is to be hoped that all national disputes may hereafter be settled
in this reasonable and Christian way.</p>

<p>8. Treaties are international laws binding on the two or
more parties making the contract; and our Foreign Representatives
(as ambassadors, ministers resident, etc.) deal with
International Law as arranged by treaties and the Laws of
Nations.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">RELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO RELIGION.</span></h3>

<p>1. Religion has always exerted so much influence on men
that it has been customary for governments to assume more or
less control over it; and, as the leaders of religious systems
have commonly been glad to get the support of governments,
there has usually existed what is called a “Union of Church
and State,” the government endorsing the views of some
special religious system, and giving more or less support to its
officials; sometimes, even refusing to tolerate any other; or,
if tolerated, reserving its special recognition and favors, and
whatever material support it chose to give to religious establishments
to that termed National, alone; that church returning
the favor by using its great influence with the people to
support the measures of the government.</p>

<p>It is very distasteful to many men who differ from the views
of the favored system to be required to support it, and to be
frowned upon by the government if they do not feel inclined to
connect themselves with it.</p>

<p>2. The Founders of our government were wise enough to
leave the people to arrange religious questions according to
their pleasure. They were not unbelievers in religion, but
thought, as most of our citizens now think, that entire liberty
should be left to all to act in religious matters as they felt able
and inclined. All religious systems are equally tolerated—no
government support is given specially to any. Some people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
do not approve of religious oaths (an affirmation in the name
of God, or calling God to witness that what is said is true,)
and from such persons a solemn affirmation or statement,
answers the purposes of the law.</p>

<p>Although neither the Constitution, nor Congress in its laws,
prescribe a religious profession of any kind, and the Constitution
prohibits Congress from making laws respecting the
establishment of a State religion, or interfering with the free
exercise of it, and declares that “no religious test shall ever be
required, as a qualification to any office or public trust, under
the United States,” neither do they discourage religion.
Respect is shown, in many ways, to religion. Congress usually
appoints a chaplain, now of one denomination, and now of
another; it allows chaplains in the army and navy, and provides
them a salary; and, of late years, the President recommends
a day of National thanksgiving to God once a year, for
the blessings we enjoy, and sometimes proclaims a day of fasting
and prayer. It shows all due respect to the religious
beliefs among the people, but leaves all free to practice any
form of it, or to reject them all.</p>

<p>3. Entire religious liberty is a rarity in the world, and is
much more favorable to the purity and weighty influence of
religious teachings than a State religion. Many of the colonies
that afterwards became States, were founded by persons who
fled from religious persecution in the countries of the Old
World, and multitudes have emigrated here to secure freedom
in the enjoyment of their religious views and practices, or even
entire freedom to reject all religion if they could not believe in
any, though that is seldom the case.</p>

<p>Our example has been much approved and is having much
influence on other nations.</p>

<h4>TOLERATION OF OPINIONS,</h4>

<p>4. Is characteristic of the American Government. Liberty
of the Press, or freedom to state any views a man may entertain,
is as complete as liberty in religious matters. Very severe
things are sometimes written and published of the government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
and sometimes things that would do much harm if they were
generally believed, and no notice is taken of it, unless some
one sees fit to contradict it or prove it to be incorrect.</p>

<p>If a man injures another’s character by writing things that
are false, he can be tried, and, if convicted, punished by the
courts. Vile and indecent writings are prohibited; but otherwise
there is entire freedom. Falsehood and error are left to be
destroyed in a natural way by the truth.</p>

<p>This is a great gain to the truth since error has often been
protected, in other countries, by government authority, on the
conviction that it was the truth, to the great prejudice of truth
itself.</p>

<p>5. Although, during the Civil War, there was some restraint
put upon the freedom of publishing things that might be
hurtful to the government, the instances were not very numerous,
and, at the close of the war the spirit of toleration was
shown in a way very creditable to our people, and very praiseworthy
in our government, which left the way open to a speedier
reunion of sentiment and sympathy in the sections that had
fought each other so bravely.</p>

<p>The brave and resolute can afford to be just to each other,
and to allow entire freedom of opinion to all. In this respect
we have fairly earned the right to call ourselves a nation of
freemen.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">CHAPLAINS.</span></h3>

<p>1. Regard to the religious habits of a large number of the
people has led Congress to appoint, or permit the appointment,
of chaplains to supply such religious instruction and services
in the army and navy as might be felt desirable by those concerned.</p>

<p>Though chaplains are not properly officers of the government,
they are employees of it, for they are appointed by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
authority, and paid from its treasury. Those in the army
receive the same pay and emoluments as a major of infantry;
or this was the compensation allowed by act of Congress in
1812. But by an act of 1862, it was fixed at $100 per month, and
two rations per day, for those in the army or hospitals. By
the act of 1812, one chaplain was allowed to every brigade;
but by an act of 1861 (during the civil war,) one for every
regiment was allowed.</p>

<p>Navy chaplains, in 1835, received $1,200 per year. But in
1860 this was raised to a lieutenant’s pay; and this in 1862 was
$1,800 per annum.</p>

<p>Chaplains in Congress receive $750 per annum.</p>

<p>2. The United States also employ a chaplain in the military
academy at West Point.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that in time of war, with
one chaplain for every regiment, and one for every ship of war,
and others in hospitals and military posts, quite a large number
of clergymen are employed by the government.</p>

<p>This provision for the religious instruction of those who
cannot, from their peculiar position, attend the preaching of
the Gospel, or other religious services, is certainly an indication
that our government respects religion, and looks after
the spiritual as well as the temporal interests of its army and
navy.</p>

<p>3. In the appointment of chaplains, the government pursues
a liberal course. No particular preference is given to any
denomination, but they are appointed from almost every religious
sect, and allowed to conduct religious services after the
forms of the church to which they respectively belong.</p>

<p>Every body knows what the duties of a chaplain are. So we
need not explain them here, and will only add that a faithful
chaplain in the army in time of war has much to do besides
preaching and holding regular services. The wounded, the
sick, and the dying, should be the particular objects of his
attention. He should not only minister religious instruction
and consolation to them, but look after their physical comforts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
Many of these clergymen, during the late most unfortunate
civil war, distinguished themselves by their exertions to promote
the bodily comforts of those unfortunate men, as well as
to give them religious instruction, not refusing to nurse the
sick and wounded wherever they could relieve their pains or
mitigate their sufferings.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">COMPROMISES.</span></h3>

<p>1. In a large and prosperous country there are very likely
to arise antagonisms of interest and sentiment which will
require the strong pressure of some common and more imperative
interest to overawe and reconcile by a process of mutual
concession, called Compromise.</p>

<p>The States of the two sections—North and South—were
unlike in several general respects; but it was in nothing so
marked as in regard to Slavery. This system was introduced
in Virginia in the same year that the Plymouth colony was
founded in Massachusetts, and spread to all the colonies, in
time; but never was much practiced north of Maryland. In
all the Southern colonies it took deep root from the first. It
formed the subject of the most difficult</p>

<h4>COMPROMISE OF THE CONSTITUTION.</h4>

<p>2. This compromise consisted of concessions made by each
section. The North conceded the return of fugitives from
their Southern masters, when escaped to the north, and an
enumeration of three-fifths of the slave population in computing
the representation in Congress. This was a great sacrifice
for that section to make, for its people were, at heart, deeply
hostile to Slavery. Both their interests and sentiments made
it important to exclude it from the new States where they were
likely to settle in considerable numbers. But a close and strong
union of the States was a vital point with them. Commerce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
trade, and manufactures, to which they were largely given,
required resources and vigor in the central government, to
maintain the public credit at home, and secure respect and
safety abroad. The South conceded the final close of the Slave
Trade at a given time (1808). Outside of the Constitution it,
at the same time, conceded the “Ordinance of 1787,” by which
Slavery was excluded from the territory north of the Ohio river.
Thus the North and South divided the country between them.</p>

<p>3. This was, however, a very troublesome subject, and
affected so many legislative questions as to be constantly coming
up for debate. The sentiments of the Northern people
grew more hostile to the institution, and the South stood on
guard with growing apprehension and anger, as this state of
feeling developed in the North; and, at the same time, it
became evident that the more rapid growth of the northern
population gave them an increasing preponderance in Congressional
representation. They jealously watched over the rights
of the State governments from their fear of Congressional or
executive interference, and industriously sought means to extend
their area and increase the number of Slave States. They were
always much assisted by a large party in the north of those
who cherished the Union and were fearful of its dissolution.
They were ever pouring oil on the troubled waters, and mediating
between the two extremes.</p>

<h4>THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE.</h4>

<p>4. The arrangement of the Slavery question so termed was
made in 1820, and took effect as to the State of Missouri in
1821. In the five years that followed the close of the last war
with England there was great activity in settlement of the
unoccupied territory, and the country gave indications of the
power of rapid development that has so strongly characterized
it since. The South foresaw the loss of its balance of power
if too many of the new States were organized as free. Missouri
had included a clause in her Constitution, presented for
the approval of Congress, prohibiting slavery. This clause the
South demanded should be stricken out. It produced great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
excitement and hot discussion throughout the country, and
seemed to threaten the stability of the Union. Both sections
were resolute in maintaining their principle, but both appreciated
the necessity of strength in the government and harmony
between the sections, and each made a sacrifice for the sake of
these. Missouri was required to admit slavery, and the condition
was annexed that no more Slave States should be formed
north of its southern line. This was a concession trying to
both sides. The North became a party to the extension of
Slavery, and the South gave definite limits to her power of
expansion. Each, however, gained something: the South a
State above the limits before virtually fixed, and the North a
definite and final limit to the extension of a hated institution.
This was quite generally satisfactory, and for many years set
that question at rest.</p>

<p>5. “Mason and Dixon’s Line” was the term applied to the
boundary between the Free and Slave States. This name originated
in colonial times. The royal grants to colonial proprietors
or companies were often very carelessly made, and those
to Lord Baltimore, the founder of Maryland, and William
Penn, the proprietor of Pennsylvania, were specially indefinite,
giving rise to adverse claims that nearly produced war along
the border. Commissioners were at length appointed, who
employed Mason and Dixon, eminent English astronomers and
surveyors, to establish the boundary, which they did satisfactorily.
The importance of the question settled, and the reputation
of the surveyors for scientific accuracy, attached their
name to the boundary permanently. It acquired political
significance afterwards, as the boundary between Maryland, the
most northern of the slave States, and Pennsylvania, the most
southern of the original free States. When new States were
formed, with the Ohio river as a boundary from its point of
departure out of Pennsylvania, that name was extended in its
application to the whole dividing line between the free and
slave States—south or north of Mason and Dixon’s Line meaning,
in slave or free territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span></p>

<p>6. After some years the southern statesmen began again to
feel apprehensive of a loss of their equality of power in the
general government, so rapidly did the northern territories fill
up. They began to look for more territory, and favored the
settlement, independence, and annexation of Texas. Though
long resisted, they succeeded in the election of 1844, with this
annexation and a probable war with Mexico as test questions,
and added not only Texas but New Mexico and California to
the territory wherein slavery, by the Missouri Compromise,
would be admissible.</p>

<p>7. Their satisfaction was not very durable. The discovery
of gold in California filled it with inhabitants so soon, and
these so largely from the free States, that in two years from its
definite acquisition it petitioned for admission into the Union
with a clause in its Constitution prohibiting Slavery. This
was very exasperating to the South, and after a long and violent
contest could be carried by the North only by the passage of
the Fugitive Slave Law—a re-enactment of a part of the Compromise
of the Constitution with provisions so vigorous and
effective, could they have been enforced, as to be, in the highest
degree, offensive to a considerable part of the northern people.
Utah was given a Territorial government as a concession to the
South, and the Slave Trade was abolished in the District of
Columbia as her corresponding concession to the North. These
were the four compromise measures of 1850, the result of a
discussion lasting nearly a year, engendering great bitterness
on both sides, and failing to satisfy either.</p>

<p>8. The attempt to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law proved
ineffectual, in the end; the rooted aversion of the Northern
people to Slavery, kept in abeyance before by less offensive compromises,
being fully aroused. This produced in the Southern
people a bitter indignation as showing a disposition to rebel
against a constitutional provision in their favor. They procured,
in 1854, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in the
famous “Kansas and Nebraska Bill,” and sought to introduce
Slavery into Kansas. A civil war in that Territory followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
which resulted in the triumph of the Northern party. The
extinction of Slavery was now apparently but a question of
time, the hostility to it in the North becoming so out-spoken
and averse to Compromises acceptable to the South, that they
began to look forward to separation, which they endeavored to
accomplish from 1860-5. A civil war, such as only Americans
could wage, was carried on during these years. The resolution,
bravery, and military talents of either side were never excelled;
but the resources of the North seemed inexhaustible. Her
numbers, activity, and the inventive genius of her skilled artisans
gave her an immense superiority. This war is a cause
at once of pride and grief to every true American. In the
contest Slavery, the cause of it, disappeared, the Constitution
was amended, and the necessity of Compromises on this question
forever ceased.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">TREASON.</span></h3>

<p>1. This is an offense aiming at the existence of the government;
and in all other governments it has ever been customary
to punish it with extreme severity. Many things are considered
to be of the nature of treason, and, as such, severely
punished in most countries. The Constitution defines treason
to be “levying war against the United States, or adhering to
their enemies, giving them aid and comfort;” so that the
highest or capital crime alone may be pursued with its penalties.
This is another evidence of the extreme moderation of
the founders of the government, which we have had occasion
to notice so often in our examination.</p>

<p>2. An act of Congress passed April 30th, 1790, defines it
in the same sense and orders that the convicted offender shall
be hung.</p>

<p>By another act passed 17th July, 1862, it was made discretionary
with the court trying the case to put the offender to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
death, or to imprison him for not less than five years, and to
fine him for a sum not less than ten thousand dollars. The
penalty for this crime, even in its mildest form, is very severe;
thus showing how atrocious this offense is considered.</p>

<p>3. None but a person owing allegiance to the United States
can commit treason against them. The same acts which would
be treason in a citizen would not be treason if perpetrated by
a foreigner.</p>

<p>“Misprision of treason” is the concealment of it by a person
who knows it has been committed. This also is a grave offense,
and is punishable by a seven years’ imprisonment, and a fine
not exceeding one thousand dollars.</p>

<p>4. Any person tried for treason, must be indicted by a
grand jury, and tried by a petit jury in the Circuit Court of
the United States within three years after the crime has been
committed; otherwise it is barred by limitation—or, in other
words, outlawed.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE UNITED STATES.</span></h3>

<p>1. Geography proper describes the general character of a
country, as its rivers, bays, gulfs, plains, mountains and natural
divisions. Leaving this to other works we confine ourselves
to those divisions made by the government for convenience in
administering its affairs.</p>

<p>Formerly there was a separation into North and South, by
“Mason and Dixon’s Line,” between which there existed a
marked difference of governmental, social, and industrial
policy. The States south of that line might hold slaves, while
in those north of it that institution was illegal. That difference
was abolished by the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution,
as a result of the Civil War. The next largest—and
these exist now—are those made by the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span></p>

<h4>CIRCUIT COURTS.</h4>

<p>2. These often comprise several States and are changed, by
act of Congress, when the convenience of the Associate Judges
of the Supreme Court, who preside over them requires it.
The next largest political divisions are</p>

<h4>THE STATES.</h4>

<p>3. These exercise sovereign powers in all matters where
control has not been expressly delegated by the Constitution
to the National Congress. The other political boundaries are
ever liable to change, to meet the requirements of changing
circumstances. These are definitely fixed, any change being
very rare and unlikely after they are duly organized and
admitted into the Union as States. Each of the original
thirteen colonies became States, with the boundaries they had
as colonies at the time of the Revolutionary War. The others
received such boundaries as suited the convenience and wishes
of the people when they were admitted. Their object is to
prevent the centralization of too much power in the general
government, and to render legislation on local affairs and interests
more convenient, and more satisfactory to the people of
each State. The State having the least number of inhabitants
numbers between 40,000 and 50,000; the one having the
largest number contains between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000.
The number of the States determines the number of Senators
in Congress, two being allotted to each; so that a State may be
considered as a Senatorial District.</p>

<h4>DISTRICT COURTS</h4>

<p>4. Produce another class of political divisions. These
attend to legal differences involving the laws of the general
government, but of a secondary class. They are more numerous
than the Circuit Courts. In some States there is but one,
and some have several, according to size and population.</p>

<h4>COLLECTION DISTRICTS.</h4>

<p>5. Another class of districts has been formed, for the purpose
of collecting the duties on imported goods. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
called “collection districts.” They extend along, and embrace
the whole sea coast and the shores of navigable lakes and rivers.
In a few instances they are located inland, at points where
goods may be brought into the United States by land. Each
collection district has a port of entry, and very often several
ports of delivery; also a collector of customs, and generally a
custom house.</p>

<p>6. Another class of collection districts was formed during
the late civil war. They grew out of the war, and were established
for the collection of the tax termed the “internal
revenue,” which had to be levied to pay the war expenses.
These districts differ entirely, both in their objects and in the
territory embraced within them, from those established for the
purpose of collecting duties on imports, and correspond as far
as practicable with the Congressional districts in each State.</p>

<h4>LAND DISTRICTS.</h4>

<p>7. Land districts may also be noticed among these divisions.
In every State and Territory where there are public lands for
sale, after they are surveyed and mapped, they are divided into
districts—two, three or four, in each State and Territory—as
convenience and economy may dictate. In each district a land
office is established for the sale of the lands in said district.</p>

<h4>LIGHT HOUSE DISTRICTS.</h4>

<p>8. Again, the whole of our sea coasts, both on the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans, together with the shores of the navigable
lakes and rivers, are divided into twelve light house districts
(or their number must not exceed that,) for the purpose of
building, repairing, illuminating and superintending the light
houses on all the coasts and shores wherever located. These
are the principal divisions we have to notice. It is important
to have a knowledge of them, for with such knowledge we can
better understand how government affairs are conducted.</p>

<h4>1783.</h4>

<p>Washington’s army had lain in camp at Newburg, N. Y., since the
surrender of Cornwallis. The Preliminary treaty of peace was signed Jan.
20th, at Paris; but it was not officially announced in the camp at Newburg,
until April 19th; just eight years from the Battle of Lexington that
commenced it!</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">July—</span>Congress prepared to disband the army, and Washington to resign
his commission as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 21—</span>The great difficulty Congress had to contend with was raising
money to pay the troops. Congress had no authority, under the
Confederation, to lay taxes or impose duties. It exhausted its
own credit in the issue of paper money which soon became of
little value. It made some foreign loans, and persuaded the States,
which alone could lay taxes, to raise a small sum. But this did
not suffice to pay the army at last. There was much suffering and
discontent.</p>

<p>On this day a body of soldiers, in large part new recruits, who
had comparatively little to complain of, without muskets, but
wearing side arms, beset the doors of Congress in Philadelphia,
for three hours. No violence was offered. Congress adjourned
to Princeton, N. J.</p>

<p>The want of public credit was very much felt. There was no authority
sufficient to raise money to meet the interest, even, on the debt; and this
produced great distress.</p>

<p>Financial troubles were now approaching a crisis. In 1784-5 the importations
from England had amounted to $30,000,000. The exportations to
only $9,000,000. Paper money was depreciated so much as to be of little
value. Debt oppressed government and people; want of vigorous authority

elsewhere, begin to threaten the internal peace of the country.</p>

<p>These and other events convinced the people that an important change

authority, alone, could answer the purpose. The States were nearly independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>

trading with France. England had nearly destroyed the French
navy and considered herself mistress of the seas. She wished to
reduce American commerce to the condition of colonial times,
which, with impressment of seamen, was the cause of the present
struggle. Our commerce was constantly growing, our people
spirited, and resolved to have their rights and Flag respected.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WAR OF 1812.</span></h3>

<p>We have stated in connection with the appropriate events, the causes of
this war which had accumulated during the last five years at a rapid rate.
The seizure and captures of American vessels by Great Britain amounted
to 917; by France to 558. Upwards of 6,000 cases of impressments were
recorded in the American Department of State; and in all these our Flag
had been violated. It was estimated that about as many more had been
made, of which no official information had been received. The Americans
were averse to war and had long borne these injuries in the hope
that a settlement might be reached by negotiation; but they insisted on
the inviolability of our Flag, and the right of naturalization. On the
commencement of hostilities 2,500 of these impressed sailors, claiming to
be American citizens, refused to fight against America, and were imprisoned
by the English government, where most of them were kept to the
close of the war.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<p><span class="date">Aug. 24—</span>The English government, however, had the magnanimity, when
news arrived of the Declaration of War by the United States, to
allow all American vessels then in their ports six weeks to dispose
of their lading and to depart undisturbed.</p>

<p>The great success of the war on the American side was on the
sea, where it was much more seriously detrimental and mortifying
to the English than victories on the land would have been. The
land forces were generally inefficiently conducted, though the
close of the war was signalized by the victory of Gen. Jackson, at
New Orleans, which was extremely gratifying to American pride.</p>

<p><span class="date">July 12—</span>Gen. Hull, with 1,800 troops, invades Canada.</p>

and most of them massacred by the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 16—</span>Gen. Hull surrendered Detroit and all the military forces and
stores in the territory to the British. He was afterward sentenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
to death by a court-martial, but pardoned by the president, though
degraded from all military command.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 19—</span>The U. S. frigate Constitution, Capt. Hull, does great honor to the
American arms by the capture of the English frigate Guerriere.
This vessel had challenged the American vessels in a contemptuous
way. She had 79 killed and wounded, the Constitution only
13. There were 10 impressed American seamen on the Guerriere.</p>

<p><span class="date">Dec. 29—</span>The U. S. frigate Constitution, Commodore Bainbridge, captures
the British frigate Java, off the coast of Brazil. American loss
44, British 151. These naval victories with so little loss produced
much exultation in America, and much surprise and mortification
in England. The Americans were able seamen, and had
long burned to avenge the insults and contempt of the English
navy. Americans are capable of extraordinary vigor when thoroughly
aroused. The operations on land had been much interfered
with by the strenuous and almost treasonable opposition of the
anti-war party, and this continued to be an embarrassment during
nearly its whole course. The general disfavor with which this
violent opposition was regarded, however, and the sympathy felt
for the President, so embarrassed, procured his re-election.</p>

<h4>1813.</h4>

<p>Military operations this year were, in part, more creditable and encouraging.
The regular force amounted to about 55,000 men; an act had been
passed authorizing the construction of four 74 gun ships, and six forty-fours;
and for an increase of the navy on the lakes.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 30—</span>The British burn Black Rock, Buffalo, three vessels of Perry’s

as a proper retaliation. The burning of Newark was barbarous,
but was avenged tenfold. Naturalized Irishmen, taken by the
British in our armies this year, were sent to England to be tried
for treason. An equal number of English officers were imprisoned
by the American government and notice given to the governor
of Canada that they should receive the same treatment and
fate as our Irish soldiers. This had its effect, and the latter
remained simply prisoners of war. This claim, and corresponding
action on the part of the English government, which was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
the principal causes of the war, was, from this time, practically
relinquished. In December an embargo was laid by Congress on
American goods and provisions, to prevent their being employed
to supply the British blockading force and armies. It produced
great discontent in New England, where a large part of the people
were dependent on commerce, and were thrown into great distress.
There was much factious, and even seditious, opposition to the
government.</p>

</div>

<h4>1814.</h4>

<p>The army operations had been unsuccessful in Canada during the last
of the campaign, owing, it was thought, to the inefficiency of the commanders,
and perhaps partly to the want of experience of their subalterns.
Changes, that were proved much for the better, were made, and the campaign
of this year, in this quarter, showed a more honorable record.
Since the commencement of the war till this year, the English government
had been carrying on an immense European war, which was closed by the
abdication of Bonaparte and his banishment to the island of Elba.
They prepared for a more vigorous effort in America, by sending considerable
armies of the veterans of Wellington, who had conquered in Europe.
They had received, the impression that the opposition to the war and the
republican party, would coöperate with them, and that they might re-establish
their dominion over their former colonies.</p>

<p>But they did not comprehend American character. Party politics have
always been conducted in a bitter and hostile spirit, but that hostility has
not been directed against their <i>institutions</i>. Extreme attachment to these,
and jealous care to preserve all rights guaranteed by the Constitution, has
always led the opposition to a close and sharp criticism of all measures of
the party in power differing from their own interpretation of Constitutional
rights. When these institutions are really in danger all parties unite in a
defense, the obstinacy and vigor of which carries everything before it. It
stops at no obstacles, hesitates before no sacrifices, and counts no odds.
This became apparent to the British during the summer, dispelled forever
their dream of conquest, and led to a peace at the close of the campaign.
The British sent 14,000 troops to Canada this spring, which was supported,
in July and August, by a large reinforcement. A strong naval force, with
a large body of troops, was sent to invade the heart of the country and capture
Washington. After failing in maintaining their ground here, they
were directed against the gulf coast and the Mississippi river, ending in
their decisive defeat by Gen. Jackson, at New Orleans, Jan. 8th, 1815, nine
days before the treaty of peace, signed at Ghent, in Belgium, Dec. 24, was
known in America.</p>

so as to co-operate in an attack on the city by water. The patriotic
song, “The Star Spangled Banner,” was written during this
bombardment of Fort M’Henry. Gen. Ross, the British commander,
was killed soon after the landing of the troops.</p>

<p><span class="date">” 28—</span>The naval war was continued some time longer. The U. S.
frigate Constitution captures two British vessels of war, the frigate
Cyane and the sloop Levant, off the island of Madeira. In March
the U. S. frigate Hornet captured the British brig Penguin, on the
coast of Brazil.</p>

<p>The British government, elated by their triumph over Bonaparte,
their large army accustomed to conquer in Europe, and the fleets
set free from the blockade of the Continent, thought to make an
easy conquest of America. But all their attempts were defeated.
Had peace been made a little later the Americans might have
obtained much better terms.</p>

<p>This war had been waged under many difficulties by the American
administration. The country and its institutions, were new,
and there was no such reserved fund of wealth and credit, as is
always found in an old and well organized state. They depended
largely on commerce, which was almost destroyed by the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
naval force of Great Britain, and the embargo policy. Our navy
was gallant and successful; but the government lacked the means,
and the unanimous support of the people, requisite to increase it
to the necessary strength. The administration did not act with
the vigor and efficiency calculated to bring all sections and classes
to its support, and the people had not yet the experience and
knowledge of the value and strength of their own institutions
needful to inspire confidence, so that they were critical and difficult
to please, and this spirit impaired the efficiency of nearly all
government measures. What they undertook could be only imperfectly
done. The old soldiers of the Revolution were dead or
unfit by age for good service, and time was necessary to train
others and ascertain who had the necessary military capacity for
conducting operations with success. Yet, under all these great
difficulties, the United States came out of the war with the respect
of the world, such as it had never before enjoyed. It became
formidable to Europe as a great and vigorous power with which
it was not safe to trifle.</p>

<p>This was still more clear when the government declared war on
the Dey of Algiers, one of the pirate princes of the North of
Africa, which, for hundreds of years, had made war on the commerce
of all nations almost with impunity. Having violated
their treaty with us, the President sent out an adequate naval force</p>

<p><span class="date">June 17-19—</span>which captured two Algerine vessels of war, and threatened
Algiers. The Dey, intimidated, immediately made
peace, giving liberty to all prisoners without ransom, and
full satisfaction for the injuries done to our commerce. No European
nation had before so humbled these pirates, and it at once
raised the credit of our government, and gained us respect and
esteem.</p>

<p><span class="date">June 30—</span>The last hostile act at sea took place in the Straits of Sunda,
in the East Indies, where the U. S. brig of war Peacock captured
the Nautilus, a British sloop of war. Thus the three American
vessels at sea when the war closed, each came home crowned
with laurels. The British vessels captured during the war numbered
1,750—the American 1,683. The spirit and energy of the
Americans, under all their embarrassments, gave an unmistakable
indication of the future greatness and power of the United States.</p>

</div>

<h4>1816.</h4>

<p>The last two years’ experience had taught the government and the people
many important lessons by which they hastened to profit. The coast was
fortified, the navy increased, manufactures and commerce encouraged, and
the best measures that the wisdom of the times could suggest, employed to
restore the finances. The violently factious opposition of parties was
much moderated by the confidence gained to our government and institutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
and the evident folly of excessive fears. The Second U.S. Bank
was chartered for 20 years, with a capital of $35,000,000.</p>

<span class="smaller">HISTORY OF THE U. S. FROM 1817 TO 1846.</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Monroe’s Administration.</span></h4>

<p>A new era for America commenced with this administration, or rather,
reached its period of uninterrupted development; for the whole past history
of the country had been a preparation for it, but especially so the late
war and its results. The failure of the French revolution, and, finally,
the failure of Napoleon Bonaparte and the re-establishment of the old monarchy
in France, as a result of the excesses, first of the French republic,
and then of the military interference of Bonaparte with the existing state
of things in Europe, had an important influence in modifying the politics
of the republican party in the United States; so that they came partially
in Jefferson’s administration, and completely by the close of Madison’s,
to follow the wise and vigorous policy pursued by Washington and the
federal party; while the general government and the institutions of the
country became deeply imbued with the regard to popular rights, and
attention to the interests and will of the people that formed the leading idea
of Jefferson and the original democrat, or, as it was then called, the republican
party. Thus the two points of supreme importance, vigor in the
general government, and security to the people, were happily mingled and
wrought into the spirit and form of our institutions.</p>

<p>The leading events of Monroe’s two administrations were the attention
given to internal improvements—among which may be mentioned the Erie
canal in New York, and the encouragements to manufactures—the acquisition
of Florida from Spain, and a definite settlement of the slavery question
(for the next thirty years only, as it proved,) by the Missouri compromise.
The people now began to feel and act together, as a single nation,
and material progress was rapid.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MEXICAN WAR.</span></h3>

<p>Texas was a nearly uninhabited part of Mexico, lying between Louisiana
and the Rio Grande river. It was a fertile region, with a fine climate.
The Spanish possessors of Mexico, in the bigoted and bitter spirit that was
traditional with the Spaniards toward protestants, and deeply hostile in
feeling from the rather high-handed and vigorous proceedings of Gen.
Jackson before and after the cession of Florida, did not encourage the settlement
of Texas; preferring to be separated by a wilderness from the
United States. In 1821 the Mexicans finally threw off the Spanish yoke
and established an independent government.</p>

<p>About this time the Americans, and especially those of the South, foreseeing
the probable spread of the northern part of the Republic to the
Pacific, began to look with covetous eyes on the fine Savannas of Texas, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
an excellent field for land speculations, and also for extending the Southern
area, so as to keep its balance in the number of slave States equal to
the free States of the North, as they had been provided for by the Missouri
Compromise. It was believed to be the plan of Mr. Calhoun, an able and
far-seeing statesman, thoroughly in earnest in the maintenance of slavery,
and the political equality of the slave with the free States. A settlement
was made by people from the United States. In a few years they
grew to be numerous, and came in conflict with the rigid Spanish Catholic
laws, still maintained by the Mexicans. The United States government
made advances toward purchasing Texas, but the Mexicans were resolute
in their purpose to hold it, and bring its people under the dominion of
strict Mexican law. The Americans resisted this with the settled determination
of ultimate separation from Mexico, and probable annexation to
the United States.</p>

<p>The Mexicans undertook to reduce them to submission. The Texans,
supported by bold and fearless adventurers from the Southern States,
resisted. The war commenced Oct. 2d, 1835, by a battle at Gonzalez, followed
by various others. March 2d, 1836, the Texans formally declared
Independence, which they maintained by force of arms. March 3d, 1837,
the United States government recognized the Independence of Texas.
England did the same in 1842. Propositions of annexation had been made
to Presidents Jackson, Van Buren, and Tyler, successively, by the Texas
government, but as often rejected by them as tending necessarily to a war
with Mexico; that power having distinctly and repeatedly declared that
she should regard such a step as a declaration of war.</p>

<p>The Democratic party regaining the ascendency in the election of 1844,
made this annexation the issue of the presidential campaign. A majority
of the people were in favor of it.</p>

<p>The Southern view, however, was not alone in its influence on this decision.
Indignities and injuries had been inflicted by the Mexicans on American
citizens in that country; its haughty, exclusive, and unfriendly spirit
awakened strong indignation; and the Pacific coast of California, with the
mining regions of the northern interior of Mexico, both nearly uninhabited,
were objects of desire to the American people. Thus a wish to extend the
bounds of the Republic, and to chastise an insolent neighbor, combined
with the ardent wishes of the pro-slavery interest, to lead the nation to determine
on a war, somewhat ungenerously, with a neighbor notoriously too
weak and disorganized for effectual resistance to the whole strength of the
United States. The whole plan, as afterward carried out, was arranged in
the cabinet at Washington almost before hostilities had actually commenced.</p>

<p>It will not be easy for an American to wholly condemn an act
that gave us California and the fertile valleys and vast mining
territory of the Pacific slope as well as New Mexico, or the chastisement
which the Mexicans had merited for their barbarity;
though he may blame the eagerness for the acquisition of territory
and the support of slavery that led us to invade another country
and humble her pride. The ability of Americans as soldiers
would appear by this war to be unrivalled, and, in that view
arouses our pride. The moral sense of the world must ever be
shocked by war, though there seem many cases in which it is far
the least of two evils. Our government was fairly generous so far
as it dared be in dealing with the vanquished, as soon as its
demands for territory were satisfied. It is also evident that this
territory will be better developed and governed than would have
been the case under Mexican rule.</p>

<p><span class="date">May 30—</span>The failure of the compromise measures of 1850 to realize the
hopes of the South from the rapid development of anti-slavery
views in the North caused the subject to be again agitated, and the
Missouri Compromise, which stopped the formation of slave States
north of its south boundary line, was repealed; the question of the
admission of slavery into Kansas and Nebraska, both being north
of that line, being referred by the famous “Kansas-Nebraska Bill”
to the “squatters,” or first settlers. This was called “squatter
sovereignty.” This measure gave satisfaction to the South, but
was strongly reprobated by many of the Northern people. Both
sides prepared to renew the contest there, and civil war raged in
Kansas for near three years. Each side sought to secure its end
which terminated in favor of the North. The South could not
compete with it in numbers nor drive the extra numbers away.
This was the last hope of the South for preserving equilibrium in
the general government.</p>

<p>The Democratic party in the North, anxious to soothe and conciliate
the South, and not holding so advanced opinions against
slavery, was still strong enough to maintain itself in power in the
administration; but the Republican party, formed about this
time by the dissolution of the Whig party, constantly grew in
numbers and influence, and, by the end of the next administration
its numbers were so large and the ultimate result so certain that
the South resolved on secession rather than give up their favorite
institution.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CIVIL WAR</span></h3>

<p>Was the inevitable result of an antagonism of interests, sentiments, and
social structure in the two great sections of the Union—the North and the
South. The foundation of these tendencies was laid before the formation
of the Union, in early colonial times. The conflict commenced as soon as
a close union was attempted, and the Constitution was adopted only
through the personal influence of Washington and other statesmen of that
time, and from the general conviction that it was essential to the protection
of the new nation from England and other European powers. Some provisions
of the Constitution involved a compromise between the North and
the South; and a constant series of compromises was required to be
arranged from time to time, down to this period.</p>

<p>The institution of slavery it was believed by many of the revolutionary
fathers, would expire of itself at no distant time; but the value of the
cotton cultivated at the South, and the intimate relations that slavery
bore to the social life, made it profitable and agreeable to that section,
and they held to it with great tenacity. Meanwhile the compromises of
the Constitution grew more and more disagreeable to the North. The
requirement of that instrument—that persons held to service in the South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
and becoming fugitives in the North, should be returned by them—was
objected to on humane and religious grounds, and they found slavery an
industrial embarrassment. The enterprise and vigor of the northern population
gave their section a more rapid growth, and its political power
became continually greater.</p>

<p>But three ways of peacefully avoiding the conflict were open: the North
must fully carry out the spirit of concession that gave birth to the Union,
the South must consent, sooner or later, to abolish its peculiar institutions,
or they must agree to separate. Interest, habit, and the aristocratic
pride of the South forbade the second; while, in the North, interest, religious
sentiment, and the workingman’s pride as decidedly forbade the first.
The natural relation of the two sections, especially by the Mississippi and
Ohio rivers, so essential to the commercial interests of the Western States:
the improbability of maintaining amicable intercourse, with slavery in
the South, and fugitives from it to produce constant irritation; the
apparent probability that, if the right of dissolution were conceded, the
West, and the Pacific States would follow this example; and the conviction
that the true interests of the whole country, internal and external,
required an indissoluble Union, inspired the majority of the northern
people to resist disunion at every cost. On the other hand, the South
claimed the right to depart in peace. Thus, war was inevitable; nor can
it be correctly affirmed that any party, or any generation, or either section
of the Union, was properly responsible for so lamentable a result. Each
section, generation, and party follows the line of its own interest, ideas,
and habits. It is a law of humanity, and each sees therein its duty and
pleasure. While interests do not clash very seriously, while ideas are not
sharply and clearly defined, and while habits are yet unsettled, compromises
may be readily effected. Humanity, taken together, in the most
advanced society heretofore known to men, is not yet capable of views so
high, liberal, and far-seeing as to free it from the possibility of such conflicts.
It will, however, reach that height, in the course of time.</p>

<p>We could not reasonably have expected either the North or the South to
have acted differently from what they did. While so gigantic a war was
an immense evil; to allow the right of peaceable secession would have
been ruin to the enterprise and thrift of the industrious laborer, and keen-eyed
business man of the North. It would have been the greatest calamity
of the age. War was less to be feared.</p>

<p>The Southerner, generous, warm blooded, accustomed to rule and make
his own will the law of others in his home, courageous and fiery, could
not give way. Besides secession would be less damaging to him. He
would own the outlets to much of Northern commerce, he had a bond of
union of the Southern States in the common institution of slavery, and
a monopoly of the world’s cotton that must soon secure profitable alliances
in Europe. Secession was commenced peaceably, and the Southern government
fairly consolidated before the trumpet sounded to battle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
Democratic party, then in possession of the administration of the general
government, had long been in close relations with the South. It was
impossible for it to realize the momentous character of the crisis, or to
help sympathizing more or less with the views and feelings of the South;
it was near the close of its period of rule; and it left the active management
of the herculean difficulties of the situation to the incoming administration
of the Republican party. The whole country was quiet, failing,
perhaps, as well as the Democrats, to realize the significance of the events
taking place. It was a period of breathless waiting for what would come
next. The signal was given by the South. Fort Sumpter in South Carolina,
a national fort, was bombarded April 12th, 1861. It was an electric
shock. The North answered the summons by a note of defiance, and mustered
for war.</p>

<p>The South was better prepared, more alert, more accustomed to arms,
and secured, at first, many advantages. She also had the advantage of
being on the defensive when the contest became close. But, as the months
ran into years, the courage and iron resolution of the North did not falter.
She had the advantage of numbers, of the general government, of wealth,
and of naval force. Step by step she conquered, holding all she gained,
grew skillful and wise by defeat, and, April 8th, 1865, the main army of the
Confederates surrendered, and the war was over; the gallant South succumbed
to the plucky North. It was a predestined conclusion. The free
States were necessarily the strongest, and their strength was supported and
inspired by religious sentiment and enthusiasm. The Union, so important
to the world and to civil liberty, was preserved, but at fearful cost.</p>

<p>Probably 500,000 lives were sacrificed altogether, on both sides; and
eight or nine billions of dollars. The desolation of the South, which had
been mainly the theater of these mighty conflicts; the extreme change in
pecuniary circumstances and social life there; the affliction, to freemen, of
the subjection, however mild and temperate, necessary under the circumstances
to be imposed, for the time, by the federal government; the great
loss of valuable life to both sides; the immense debt of the government,
with the unavoidable demoralization of certain parts of society,
everywhere, by the license of war, and many other evils form the dark side
of the picture.</p>

<p>Yet, nothing could outweigh the value of the Union especially when
freed from the discordant element that now disappeared. It must be long
before all wounds can be healed. When that time shall come both North
and South will be recompensed for all they have suffered.</p>

<span class="smaller">FIRST PHASE OF THE WAR.</span></h3>

<p>Each side hesitated to strike the first blow; but the South, being best
prepared, and to end a suspense that threatened to be hurtful to their
cause, opened the conflict by the bombardment of Ft. Sumter. Each
now hastened preparations with vigor. Yet so long had been the intimate,
friendly relations, that neither could believe in a long, deadly struggle.
More than three months passed, during which frequent skirmishes occurred;
but the leaders avoided bringing on a general battle. The Southern
forces advanced toward Washington, but stopped short of an attack,
sending out small bodies to make trial efforts, and get possession of important
points.</p>

<p>The battle of Bull Run was the first great, serious combat. The brilliant
bravery of Southern troops would have been overcome but for an opportune
reinforcement at the decisive moment. The leaders did not feel it
safe to pursue the vanquished Federals to Washington. There was a large
reserve force there. Thus, if they won a battle they lost the object sought—the
capture of the national Capital—and the Union forces, though defeated,
gained the most important point—the protection of Washington.</p>

<p>Both sides now recognized the magnitude of the undertaking; the
indomitable resolution of their opponents; and the need of thoroughly
disciplining their troops, of organizing all branches of the military and
naval service, and gathering stores, and distributing forces in accordance
with the plan proposed by each.</p>

<p>This period continued until Feb., 1862. The U. S. Navy was increased
from 42 vessels at the beginning of the war to about 300 at the close of this
preparatory period. These blockaded the South and served for transport and
attack. Two series of operations were planned by the U. S. government
for the land forces: one in the Mississippi Valley and one in Virginia.
In the meantime the Confederate leaders saw that it was impossible to
invade the North as they had proposed without long preparation and large
armies. They organized with speed but were thrown on the defensive.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SECOND PHASE OF THE WAR.</span></h3>

<p>The previous period, though abounding in battles, so-called, were really
skirmishes of detached bodies without any well defined plan. It covered
much of the surface of all the Border States, but especially Virginia and
Missouri, and was a trial of bravery and strategy in which both parties
learned how to fight, and of what metal their opponents were made.</p>

<p>The Second Period covered about eleven months—from the advance of
the Federal armies on the South in West and East, in Feb., to the close of
the year.</p>

<p>This period is defined in its commencement, by the surrounding of the
southern territory on nearly all sides by the Union forces, both naval and
military; and the inauguration of aggressive movements both by sea and
land; and in its close by the failure of the two southern Generals, Bragg
in the West, and Lee in the East, in the endeavor to break through this
beleaguering line. It was an immense and desperate conflict.</p>

<p>In the West it began by the attack of Grant on Fts. Henry and Donelson,
followed up by the battle of Pittsburg Landing, and various other
operations in Tennessee and Mississippi; the advance of McClellan on
Richmond, and his campaign in the Peninsula, his failure and return to
Washington; the strengthening of the Southern Army, and the advance
of Lee northward into Maryland and his defeat there. The disasters to
the Union army in Virginia served to check the successes of the Western
Army under Grant, Sherman, Buell, Rosecranz and others; the Confederate
forces in the West were increased under Bragg, who checked the
advance of U. S. troops eastward at Chattanooga, and he himself assumed
the offensive, by invading Kentucky. He was compelled to retreat again
to Chattanooga. Thus there was an alternation of great successes and
great reverses on both sides.</p>

<p>The Union Army commenced with about 600,000 men, and the Southern
with about 400,000. They both largely added to these during the campaign.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the navy was not idle. A foothold was gained in South
Carolina, and in North Carolina, as well as at Norfolk, Virginia, the
mouth of the Mississippi was opened by Admiral Farragut, and New Orleans
captured. The compression of a vast naval and land force was
applied in all directions, even west of the Mississippi. Missouri had been
quieted by driving the organized forces into the border of Arkansas, and
inflicting on them a heavy blow at Pea Ridge. This, however, was not
followed up; the disasters to the Union cause in Virginia, and the rebound
of the Confederates in East Tennessee, requiring concentration.</p>

<p>The South had shown the most determined bravery, and great steadiness
in disaster; and activity, and ability in making the most of circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
The speed with which she collected other levies and armies and used them
within the campaign greatly impressed the authorities and people of the
Federal government. They were convinced that the blacks left at home
to till the ground, or employed in the fortifications and other labor of the
war, contributed much to the strength of the South; enabling them to
concentrate all their resources on a given point with extreme rapidity,
and to use all their best fighting material. After so vast an outlay, to see
their immense armies defied and the Northern States threatened with invasion
was discouraging. Hitherto slavery had not been interfered with
much, in deference to the sentiment in the Border States, and the views of
the democratic party. The Union administration determined to weaken
the South by abstracting as much as possible of the slave element from it
and to use it themselves. The issue of the Proclamation of Emancipation
marks a Third Phase of the War.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">CAMPAIGN OF 1863.</span></h3>

<p>The preliminary Proclamation of Emancipation, issued Sept. 22d, 1862,
was not to take effect for 100 days, or until Jan. 1st, 1863. Meanwhile the
final details of the great operations, undertaken on both sides during 1862,
were wound up. The bold efforts of the South, in the East and West, to
transfer the war into the North, and indemnify themselves for the strict
blockade of the coast by drawing supplies from the enemy, had resulted
in defeat and withdrawal; not unaccompanied with booty, especially in
the west, where Bragg’s train of supplies was said to have been 40 miles
long. The southern people had failed in the main point, yet they had
gained much. Federal reverses in the east had stopped the victories in
the west in mid career, both by withdrawing from those armies to the east,
and adding to the Confederates from the same region. Grant and Sherman
failed at Vicksburg, and Buell at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Yet these reverses to the Union arms served to stimulate the north, and
to demonstrate the energy, resources, and indomitable resolution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
National government, and to undeceive the South as to the real sentiments
of the great body of the Democratic party from which they had hoped aid
on an invasion in force. Several of the European Powers, who would
have liked to support the South, seeing the formidable character of the
General Government, drew back in fear. The South might have foreseen
that her cause was really hopeless; but she was too American not to feel
an unconquerable resolution to carry her point or perish. She strengthened
her armies and prepared for another invasion.</p>

<p>The Federal armies were now (Jan. 1863,) about 800,000 strong; her
navy consisted of near 450 vessels, a large number being iron-clads.
The great events of the campaign were Lee’s invasion of Pennsylvania
and his retreat after the battle of Gettysburg, and Grant’s success at Vicksburg
and Chattanooga. The resolution of the South, enveloped in the
embrace of so mighty an antagonist, was wonderful; the unfaltering
spirit, and readiness of the northern people to furnish whatever was
required for success was still more so. The whole South, at least every
State, was the theater of many contests of more or less importance; but
the main interest centered on the Mississippi river, at Chattanooga and its
vicinity, and on Gen. Lee’s army in Virginia or Pennsylvania. It was a
contest of giants; yet, struggle as she might, the South was doomed. At
the end of this year she was still strong, her armies were veterans, her
spirit unbroken. The Federal Government had gained much, but it was
step by step, inch by inch; and, in some parts, as in Virginia, what had
been gained many times over, in territory, had been as often lost.
Her general gain over the Confederate States lay most largely in the
fatal process of exhaustion to which the vast operations of the Federal
government forced the South. Increase of numbers made the battles more
bloody and wasteful of life. The three leading events in this campaign—the
capture of Vicksburg, (the battle of Chickamauga was a Confederate
victory, but balanced by that of Chattanooga,) the battle of Gettysburg,
and the battle of Chattanooga—were all decisive against the Confederates,
yet leaving her strength for a long and vigorous contest of more than a
year and a half.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CAMPAIGN OF 1864.</span></h3>

<p>There was a lull, for a time, in the tempest of war. The Confederate
forces had lost ground that they could hardly hope to regain. The Mississippi
river and Eastern Tennessee, both of supreme importance to the
Confederacy, were in possession of the Union armies, which grew ever
stronger. They were now about 1,000,000 men, and the navy had increased
to over 600 vessels. This force was soon put in vigorous hands, that
gripped fast what they once held. The misfortune of many commanders
and continual changes, from political rather than military considerations,
began to be well understood. Grant had gained so uniformly when others
had failed, he was recognized as so tenacious and unwearied, that he received
and held the confidence of the people and the government. This was a
point of great importance for shortening the war; for the Southern people
were still resolute, had still a vast country, were on the defensive in a
smaller region than before, and could resist more effectively with a smaller
army. It still made a most gallant and determined resistance which the
vast resources of the national government did not enable them to overcome
for a year and a half. The country was still covered with detached bodies
of troops. A desultory war was maintained where strong armies failed to
hold the ground, or were concentrated at a few points. The great movements
were in Virginia and Georgia. The secondary in Tennessee, in Mississippi,
and Texas.</p>

<p>It took a year to break the will of the Southern people after they were
really conquered. This period covers the year 1864; 1865 furnishes only
the dying struggles of the Confederacy, already mortally wounded.</p>

<h4>1864.</h4>

<p>The bombardment of Charleston continued during the preceding month.
Some cavalry movements were made, the President of the U. S. offered
amnesty to all who would take an oath of allegiance, and Gen. Butler
announced that the Confederate government refused to receive any more
supplies for Union prisoners from the North.</p>

were undertaken. That of Sherman to Meridian, in Miss., and of

<span class="smaller">CONCLUDING CAMPAIGN.</span></h3>

<p>The year 1864 closed in general disaster to the Confederacy. Sherman
had broken the Confederate power in Georgia, destroyed its communications
with the Mississippi States, and taken Savannah. Gen. Thomas had
broken up Hood’s army, in Tennessee, and Grant had closely beleagured
the Southern army in Virginia within Richmond and its defenses; while
Sheridan had dealt blow after blow on Early, in the Shenandoah Valley,
and quite ruined his army.</p>

<p>The future operations required the subjugation of the interiors of North
and South Carolina, the taking of a few forts on the coast, and the capture
of Lee’s army in Richmond. The only other army of strength, the remnant
of Hood’s forces, was in the Southern interior. The Federal government
was stronger than ever, both by sea and land. The Southern people were
much discouraged; their finances ruined; their fighting men mostly disabled,
scattered, forced into submission, or, hopeless of ultimate success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
had voluntarily withdrawn from the contest in so large numbers that the
Confederate forces were everywhere inferior, and only upheld by the indomitable
pride and bravery inherent in the Anglo-American. They would
submit only when necessity absolutely compelled them; and thus saved
their honor, in their own eyes. They had made a fatal mistake, and they
reaped the full harvest of ruin. Yet, their prolonged resistance served to
utterly annihilate slavery; raised the negroes to the honorable position of
Defenders of the Union; and, the last of Jan., 1865, an amendment to the
U. S. Constitution was prepared forever abolishing slavery in the country.
In the end the blacks became citizens. We have now but a short record
to complete our View of the Civil War. The South had still over 100,000
men in arms, but they were surrounded, cut off from supplies, outnumbered,
and pressed with relentless vigor. This was Grant’s policy.</p>

<h4>GENERAL DATA.</h4>

<p>The number of volunteer troops to be mustered out of the Union army,
May 1st, 1865, was 1,034,064. They were mostly discharged and paid in
the next three months. The entire enlistments in the Federal army, during
the whole war, were 2,688,523. Many were re-enlistments. It is believed
that the whole number of individuals forming the armies was only 1,500,000.
75 per cent. were native Americans, 9 per cent. Germans, and 7 per cent.
Irish. Various nationalities made up the remaining 9 per cent.</p>

<p>Of this million and a half 56,000 were killed in battle, 35,000 died in
hospitals of their wounds received in battle, and 184,000 died in hospitals
of disease. Many afterwards died, and others were ruined in health for
life.</p>

<p>It has been stated by the Adjutant General of the Confederate army, since
the close of the war, that the available Confederate force during the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
war was 600,000, and that they never had more than 200,000 in the field at
any one time. This would seem likely to be an underestimate, but is the
nearest to official data that we have. He states the entire force opposing
the 1,000,000 men in the closing campaign to have been 100,000. There is
reason to believe that the Confederates killed, and the wounded and sick
who died in hospital, was about 300,000.</p>

<p>The entire amount expended by the National government, by States,
counties and towns, and contributed in other ways to the comfort or sustenance
of the army, is computed at $4,000,000,000. The support of the
Southern army cannot be ascertained, but it is thought that those expenses
and the destruction of property inflicted about an equal loss on them.</p>

<p>These losses in life and property are fearful; but they are the price of
Freedom and of Nationality. The general prosperity of the country has
made it richer than before, while natural increase and immigration have
filled the places vacant by death.</p>

<p>The South was hopeless and exhausted at the close of the war. It had
been feared that a guerrilla war, the most desolating and bloody of all
wars, would follow the defeat of the great armies. It could result only in
destruction of what remained to the Southern people, and they submitted
quietly to their fate. Various excesses and deeds of blood were indeed
committed, but they were not sympathized with by the mass of the people.
It was only the desperate and lawless class that came to the surface naturally
in war.</p>

<p>Many of the influential Southern leaders counseled submission to inevitable
necessity, and themselves set the example. The policy of reconstruction
adopted by the National government, excluded, at first, all who had
taken a part in the rebellion from political influence. The loyal element,
small as it was, was alone to restore the Southern States to their place in
the Union. It was, however, proposed to admit others, both individuals
and classes, to participation in political action as they proved themselves
trustworthy and loyal to the new order of things. After some years, and
when it was felt to be quite safe, these disabilities were nearly all removed.</p>

<p>The most distasteful act of the General Government, to the people of the
South, was clothing the blacks with the rights of citizens. They received
the elective franchise, and assisted to rule over their former masters. It
was considered necessary, since they had now no masters to be interested in
them, to give them the power to protect themselves, and to elevate them to
something of influence and respectability by force of the ballot. That
advantage given them, they must take their chances with others, and win
their own way. They had been loyal to the Union, which strongly recommended
this policy to the government. The Northern people who now
settled in the South and the blacks mainly reorganized the State governments.
This was the chief punishment inflicted on the Southern people
in retaliation for the war they had waged with such fearful energy. It was
a clemency quite unexampled in history. No blood was shed after they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
laid down their arms. The assassination of the beloved President Lincoln
made the North thoroughly angry, but no vengeance was taken except on
those believed to be immediately connected with the atrocious deed. The
most lively indignation had long been felt at the dreadful treatment experienced
by prisoners of war in some of the prisons of the South; but the
government and the people contented themselves with the punishment of
the governor of Andersonville prison, on due civil trial and conviction.</p>

<p>On the whole, the conduct of the Northern people was extremely magnanimous.
The dissolution of the Union would have been an irreparable
loss to them; they resolved not to suffer it; and, with extraordinary energy,
they put in the field more than a million and a half of men, and near 700
vessels, to subdue it, and suffered no reverses to discourage them until this
was done. When resistance ceased and the Union was secure, they exacted
only the pledges necessary to keep it safe. Appreciating the unfortunate
condition to which nearly all the before prosperous classes of the South
were reduced, they aided them in their distress, ceased at once all hostile
action, and left them to recover from their disasters under as favorable circumstances
as their own conduct warranted. The South naturally felt an
affection for her Lost Cause, proportionate to the sacrifices she had made
and the suffering she had endured for it. Time, and busy care to develop
the vast resources that slavery had, in great part, neglected, would
gradually restore them to right feeling, and the state of mind fitting them
for citizenship. This, in part, has already taken place, and, by and by, the
Bonds of the Whole Union will be more firmly cemented than ever before.
May it be soon.</p>

definitely closed, and the final seal set on the policy of reconstruction
by the inauguration of Gen. Grant, and the continuance of
the Republican party in power by the people, together with the
readmission of most of the Southern States and the possibility of
the reversal of the decision in regard to slavery done away by the
adoption of the fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, giving
the elective franchise to the colored population. Much emphasis
was given to all these things by the prosperity of the country, and
the rapid reduction of the debt, by the generally wise conduct of
the Southern people, and the slowly increasing prosperity of that
section. These results reacted in other countries to strengthen
the tendency to freer and more popular governments, and seem, in
some respects to have introduced the Era of Republicanism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smaller">PARLIAMENTARY RULES.</span></h3>

<p>We give in this chapter the Standing Rules and Orders for conducting
business in the House of Representatives of the United States, as a proper
compend of parliamentary rules for the people of the United States. They
are naturally a standard of procedure in all public bodies in this country
so far as the circumstances are parallel; they have been carefully compiled
and adopted by our highest popular Legislative Body during the course of
more than three-quarters of a century, and may therefore be considered
thoroughly well adapted to the genius of our people and the character of
our institutions; and they were originally based on Jefferson’s Manual,
compiled by him for the use, and at the request of the Senate when, as
Vice-President of the United States, he became its presiding officer, and
was digested by him from the usages of the English Parliament and other
Legislative bodies in Europe.</p>

<p>The value of this manual is attested by its use continued to the present
day, so far as it is applicable. The Rules of the House are therefore representative
of the wisdom of the Old World on this point as well as of the
usages of the New.</p>

<p>They deserve to be carefully studied by American citizens above any
other body of parliamentary rules for several reasons besides those mentioned
above. Hardly any other will be likely to contain so many points
of adaptation to popular use; every one should be fairly acquainted with
the prevailing usages that he may be ready to act his part well if called on
to preside in any public meeting; all who read the reports of congressional
doings require such acquaintance with parliamentary usage to fully appreciate
many points in such reports, and these Rules are a fine illustration of
the spirit of our government and the genius of the American people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span></p>

<p>We see, in the most impressive manner, that the utmost pain is taken to
make Legislative work orderly, decorous, and as rapid as is consistent with
due care that what is done shall be well and carefully done; that no pains
are spared, <i>in regulations</i>, that every legislator shall have the means of knowing
all that is his special business to know; and we discover that proper care
is taken to see that economy and faithfulness are constantly observed by all
the officers of the government. If this is not always actually the case there
is, at least, no fault in the <i>arrangements, rules and orders</i> to that effect. All
the people should know to what they may properly hold their Representatives
accountable, and they will be prepared to judge of the extent
of obedience or transgression. The Rules are just and good. Let the
people see that they are properly observed.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has 160 Rules, the Senate 52, and the
Joint Rules of the House and Senate, regulating their intercourse with
each other, number 22. Whatever of difference exists between them is
unimportant after due allowance is made for the different character and
constitution of the two bodies. The principles on which they are founded
are identical.</p>

<h4>STANDING RULES AND ORDERS FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE UNITED STATES.</h4>

<h5>THE DUTY OF THE SPEAKER.</h5>

<p>1. He shall take the chair every day precisely at the hour to which the
House shall have adjourned on the preceding day; shall immediately call
the members to order; and, on the appearance of a quorum, shall cause
the journal of the preceding day to be read.</p>

<p>2. He shall preserve order and decorum; may speak to points of order
in preference to other members, rising from his seat for that purpose; and
shall decide questions of order, subject to an appeal to the House by any
two members—on which appeal no member shall speak more than once,
unless by leave of the House.</p>

<p>3. He shall rise to put a question, but may state it sitting.</p>

<p>4. Questions shall be distinctly put in this form, to wit: “As many as
are of opinion that (as the question may be) say <i>Aye</i>;” and after the
affirmative voice is expressed, “As many as are of the contrary opinion
say <i>No</i>.” If the Speaker doubt, or a division be called for, the House
shall divide; those in the affirmative of the question shall first rise from
their seats, and afterwards those in the negative. If the Speaker still
doubt, or a count be required by at least one-fifth of the quorum of the
members, the Speaker shall name two members, one from each side, to tell
the members in the affirmative and negative—which being reported, he
shall rise and state the decision to the House.</p>

<p>5. The Speaker shall examine and correct the journal before it is read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
He shall have a general direction of the hall, and the unappropriated
rooms in that part of the capitol assigned to the House shall be subject to
his order and disposal until the further order of the House. He shall have
a right to name any member to perform the duties of the chair, but such
substitution shall not extend beyond an adjournment.</p>

<p>6. No person shall be permitted to perform divine service in the chamber
occupied by the House of Representatives, unless with the consent of
the Speaker.</p>

<p>7. In all cases of ballot by the House, the Speaker shall vote; in other
cases he shall not be required to vote, unless the House be equally divided,
or unless his vote, if given to the minority, will make the division equal;
and in case of such equal division, the question shall be lost.</p>

<p>8. All acts, addresses, and joint resolutions, shall be signed by the
Speaker; and all writs, warrants, and subpœnas, issued by order of the
House, shall be under his hand and seal, attested by the clerk.</p>

<p>9. In case of any disturbance or disorderly conduct in the galleries or
lobby, the Speaker (or Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House,)

<p>10. There shall be elected at the commencement of each Congress, to
continue in office until their successors are appointed, a clerk, sergeant-at-arms,
doorkeeper, and postmaster, each of whom shall take an oath for the
true and faithful discharge of the duties of his office, to the best of his
knowledge and abilities, and to keep the secrets of the House; and the
appointees of the doorkeeper and postmaster shall be subject to the
approval of the Speaker; and, in all cases of election by the House of its
officers, the vote shall be taken <i>viva voce</i>.</p>

<p>11. In all cases where other than members of the House may be eligible
to an office by the election of the House, there shall be a previous
nomination.</p>

<p>12. In all other cases of ballot than for committees, a majority of the
votes given shall be necessary to an election; and where there shall not be
such a majority on the first ballot, the ballots shall be repeated until a
majority be obtained. And in all ballotings blanks shall be rejected, and
not taken into the count in enumeration of the votes, or reported by the
tellers.</p>

<p>13. It shall be the duty of the clerk to make and cause to be printed
and delivered to each member at the commencement of every session of
Congress, a list of the reports which it is the duty of any officer or department
of the government to make to Congress; referring to the act or resolution
and page of the volume of the laws or journal in which it may be
contained, and placing under the name of each officer the list of reports
required to be made, and the time when the report may be expected.</p>

<p>14. It shall be the duty of the clerk of the House at the end of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
session, to send a printed copy of the journals thereof to the Executive,
and to each branch of the Legislature of every State.</p>

extra copy, in good binding, of all the documents printed by order of
either House at each future session of Congress.</p>

<p>19. The clerk shall make a weekly statement of the resolutions and
bills (Senate bills inclusive) upon the Speaker’s table accompanied with a
brief reference to the orders and proceedings of the House upon each, and

<h5>ORDER OF BUSINESS OF THE DAY.</h5>

of, reports from committees shall be called for and disposed of; in
doing which the Speaker shall call upon each standing committee in regular
order, and then upon select committees; and if the Speaker shall not

business, he shall resume the next call where he left off, giving preference

shall have occupied the morning hour on two days, it shall not be

on each alternate Monday, which shall commence as soon as the
journal is read, all bills reported during the first hour after the
journal is read shall be committed, without debate, to the Committee of
the Whole, and together with their accompanying reports, printed; and
if during the hour all the committees are not called, then, on the next
alternate Monday, the Speaker shall commence where such call was suspended:
Provided, That no bill reported under the call on alternate Mondays,
and committed, shall be again brought before the House by a motion
to reconsider.</p>

<p>52. Reports from committees having been presented and disposed of,
the Speaker shall call for resolutions from the members of each State and
delegate from each Territory, beginning with Maine and the Territory last
organized, alternately; and they shall not be debated on the very day of
their being presented, nor on any day assigned by the House for the receipt
of resolutions, unless where the House shall direct otherwise, but shall lie
on the table, to be taken up in the order in which they are presented; and
if on any day the whole of the States and Territories shall not be called,
the Speaker shall begin on the next day where he left off the previous day:
Provided, That no member shall offer more than one resolution, or one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>

consent of the House, and all such propositions shall be taken up
for consideration in the order they were presented, immediately after
reports are called for from select committees, and when adopted the clerk
shall cause the same to be delivered.</p>

and resolutions, it shall be in order, pending the consideration or discussion

if not otherwise ordered by a majority of the House, they are to be
laid on the table in general file of bills on the Speaker’s table, to be
taken up in their turn.</p>

<p>4th. Engrossed bills and bills from the Senate on their third reading.</p>

engrossment, or on being ordered to a third reading, to be taken up
and considered in the order of time in which they passed to a second

</div>

<p>The messages, communications and bills on his table having been disposed
of, the Speaker shall then proceed to call the orders of the day.</p>

<p>55. The business specified in the 54th and 130th rules shall be done at
no other part of the day, except by permission of the House.</p>

<p>56. The consideration of the unfinished business in which the House
may be engaged at an adjournment shall be resumed as soon as the journal

on Printing on the part of the House, all drawings, maps, charts, or
other papers which may at any time come before the House for engraving,
lithographing, or publishing in any way; which committee shall report

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span></p>

<p>102. Seven additional standing committees shall be appointed at the
commencement of the first session in each Congress, whose duties shall
continue until the first session of the ensuing Congress.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">COMMITTEES, TO CONSIST OF FIVE MEMBERS EACH.</p>

<p>1. A committee on so much of the public accounts and expenditures as
relates to the Department of State;</p>

<p>2. A committee on so much of the public accounts and expenditures as
relates to the Treasury Department;</p>

<p>3. A committee on so much of the public accounts and expenditures as

<p>6. A committee on so much of the public accounts and expenditures as
relates to the Public Buildings; and</p>

<p>7. A committee on so much of the public accounts and expenditures as
relates to the Interior Department.</p>

</div>

<p>103. It shall be the duty of the said committees to examine into the
state of the accounts and expenditures respectively submitted to them, and
to inquire and to report particularly—</p>

<p>Whether the expenditures of the respective departments are justified by
law;</p>

<p>Whether the claims from time to time satisfied and discharged by the
respective departments are supported by sufficient vouchers, establishing
their justness both as to their character and amount.</p>

<p>Whether such claims have been discharged out of funds appropriated
therefor, and whether all moneys have been disbursed in conformity with
appropriation laws; and</p>

<p>Whether any, and what, provisions are necessary to be adopted, to provide
more perfectly for the proper application of the public moneys, and
to secure the government from demands unjust in their character or extravagant
in their amount.</p>

<p>And it shall be, moreover, the duty of the said committees to report, from
time to time, whether any, and what, retrenchment can be made in the
expenditures of the several departments, without detriment to the public
service; whether any, and what, abuses at any time exist in the failure to
enforce the payment of moneys which may be due to the United States
from public defaulters or others; and to report, from time to time, such
provisions and arrangements as may be necessary to add to the economy
of the several departments and the accountability of their officers.</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of the several committees on public expenditures to
inquire whether any officers belonging to the branches or departments,
respectively, concerning whose expenditures it is their duty to inquire,
have become useless or unnecessary; and to report from time to time, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
the expediency of modifying or abolishing the same; also to examine into
the pay and emoluments of all officers under the laws of the United States;
and to report from time to time such a reduction or increase thereof as a
just economy and the public service may require.</p>

<h5>OF COMMITTEES OF THE WHOLE.</h5>

<p>104. The House may at any time, by a vote of a majority of the members
present, suspend the rules and orders for the purpose of going into
the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union; and also
for providing for the discharge of the Committee of the Whole House, and
the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, from the
further consideration of any bill referred to it, after acting without debate
on all amendments pending and that may be offered.</p>

<p>105. In forming a Committee of the Whole House, the Speaker shall
leave his chair, and a chairman to preside in committee shall be appointed
by the Speaker.</p>

<p>106. Whenever the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union,
or the Committee of the Whole House, finds itself without a quorum,
the chairman shall cause the roll of the House to be called, and thereupon
the committee shall rise, and the chairman shall report the names
of the absentees to the House, which shall be entered on the journal.</p>

<p>107. Upon bills committed to a Committee of the Whole House, the
bill shall be first read throughout by the clerk, and then again read and
debated by clauses, leaving the preamble to be last considered; the body
of the bill shall not be defaced or interlined; but all amendments, noting
the page and line, shall be duly entered by the clerk on a separate paper,
as the same shall be agreed to by the committee, and so reported to the
House. After report, the bill shall again be subject to be debated and
amended by clauses, before a question to engross it be taken.</p>

<p>108. All amendments made to an original motion in committee shall be
incorporated with the motion, and so reported.</p>

<p>109. All amendments made to a report committed to a Committee of
the Whole House shall be noted and reported, as in the case of bills.</p>

<p>110. No motion or proposition for a tax or charge upon the people shall
be discussed the day on which it is made or offered, and every such proposition
shall receive its first discussion in a Committee of the Whole House.</p>

<p>111. No sum or quantum of tax or duty, voted by a Committee of the
Whole House, shall be increased in the House until the motion or proposition
for such increase shall be first discussed and voted in a Committee
of the Whole House; and so in respect to the time of its continuance.</p>

<p>112. All proceedings touching appropriations of money shall be first
discussed in a Committee of the Whole House.</p>

<p>113. The rules of proceedings in the House shall be observed in a Committee
of the Whole House, so far as they may be applicable, except the
rule limiting the times of speaking; but no member shall speak twice to
any question until every member choosing to speak shall have spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span></p>

<p>114. In Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union, the bills
shall be taken up and disposed of in their order on the calendar; but when
objection is made to the consideration of a bill, a majority of the committee
shall decide, without debate, whether it shall be taken up and disposed
of, or laid aside; provided, that general appropriation bills, and, in time
of war, bills for raising men or money, and bills concerning a treaty of
peace, shall be preferred to all other bills at the discretion of the committee;
and when demanded by any member, the question shall first be put in
regard to them; and all debate on special orders shall be confined strictly
to the measure under consideration.</p>

<h5>OF BILLS.</h5>

<p>115. Every bill shall be introduced on the report of a committee, or by
motion for leave. In the latter case, at least one day’s notice shall be given
of the motion in the House, or by filing a memorandum thereof with the
clerk, and having it entered on the journal; and the motion shall be made,
and the bill introduced, if leave is given, when resolutions are called for;
such motion, or the bill when introduced, may be committed.</p>

<p>116. Every bill shall receive three several readings in the House previous
to its passage; and the bills shall be dispatched in order as they
were introduced, unless where the House shall direct otherwise; but no
bill shall be twice read on the same day, without special order of the
House.</p>

<p>117. The first reading of a bill shall be for information, and if opposition
be made to it, the question shall be, “Shall this bill be rejected?” If
no opposition be made, or if the question to reject be negatived, the bill
shall go to its second reading without a question.</p>

<p>118. Upon the second reading of a bill, the Speaker shall state it as
ready for commitment or engrossment; and if committed, then a question
shall be, whether to a select or standing committee, or to a Committee of
the Whole House; if to a Committee of the Whole House, the House shall
determine on what day; if no motion be made to commit, the question
shall be stated on its engrossment; and if it be not ordered to be engrossed
on the day of its being reported, it shall be placed on the general file on
the Speaker’s table, to be taken up in order. But if the bill be ordered to
be engrossed, the House shall appoint the day when it shall be read the
third time.</p>

<p>119. General appropriation bills shall be in order in preference to any
other bill of a public nature unless otherwise ordered by a majority of the
House.</p>

<p>And the House may, at any time, by a vote of the majority of the
members present, make any of the general appropriation bills a special
order.</p>

<p>120. No appropriation shall be reported in such general appropriation
bills, or be in order as an amendment thereto, for any expenditure not
previously authorized by law, unless in continuation of appropriations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
such public works and objects as are already in progress, and for the
contingencies for carrying on the several departments of the government.</p>

<p>121. Upon the engrossment of any bill making appropriations of money
for works of internal improvement of any kind or description, it shall be
in the power of any member to call for a division of the question, so as to
take a separate vote of the House upon each item of improvement or
appropriation contained in said bill, or upon such items separately, and
others collectively, as the members making the call may specify; and, if
one-fifth of the members present second said call, it shall be the duty of
the Speaker to make such divisions of the question, and put them to vote
accordingly.</p>

<p>122. The bills from the Court of Claims shall, on being laid before the
House, be read a first and second time, committed to a Committee of the
Whole House, and, together with the accompanying reports, printed.</p>

<p>123. A motion to strike out the enacting words of a bill shall have precedence
of a motion to amend; and, if carried, shall be considered equivalent
to its rejection. Whenever a bill is reported from a Committee of
the Whole, with a recommendation to strike out the enacting words, and
such recommendation is disagreed to by the House, the bill shall stand
recommitted to the said committees without further action by the House.</p>

<p>124. After commitment and report thereof to the House, or at any time
before its passage, a bill may be recommitted; and should such recommitment
take place after its engrossment, and an amendment be reported and
agreed to by the House, the question shall be again put on the engrossment
of the bill.</p>

<p>125. All bills ordered to be engrossed shall be executed in a fair round
hand.</p>

<p>126. No amendment by way of rider shall be received to any bill on its
third reading.</p>

<p>127. When a bill shall pass, it shall be certified by the clerk, noting the
day of its passage at the foot thereof.</p>

<h5>LOCAL OR PRIVATE BUSINESS.</h5>

<p>128. Friday and Saturday of every week shall be set apart for the consideration
of private bills and private business, in preference to any other,
unless otherwise determined by a majority of the House.</p>

<p>129. On the first and fourth Friday and Saturday of each month the
calendar of private bills shall be called over (the chairman of the Committee
of the Whole House commencing the call where he left off the
previous day,) and the bills to the passage of which no objection shall
then be made shall be first considered and disposed of. But when a bill is
again reached, after having been once objected to, the committee shall consider
and dispose of the same, unless it shall again be objected to by at
least five members.</p>

<h5>OF BILLS ON LEAVE AND RESOLUTIONS.</h5>

<p>130. All the States and Territories shall be called for bills on leave and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
resolutions on each alternate Monday during each session of Congress;
and, if necessary to secure the object on said days, all resolutions which
shall give rise to debate shall lie over for discussion, under the rules of the
House already established; and the whole of said days shall be appropriated
to bills on leave and resolutions, until all the States and Territories
are called through. And the Speaker shall first call the States and Territories
for bills on leave; and all bills so introduced during the first hour
after the journal is read shall be referred, without debate, to their appropriate
committees; provided, however, that a bill so introduced and
referred shall not be brought back into the House upon a motion to
reconsider.</p>

<h5>OF PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.</h5>

<p>131. Members having petitions and memorials to present, may hand
them to the clerk, indorsing the same with their names, and the reference
or disposition to be made thereof; and such petitions and memorials shall
be entered on the journal, subject to the control and direction of the
Speaker; and if any petition or memorial be so handed in, which, in the
judgment of the Speaker, is excluded by the rules, the same shall be
returned to the member from whom it was received.</p>

<h5>OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION.</h5>

<p>132. The previous question shall be in this form: “Shall the main
question be now put?” It shall only be admitted when demanded by a
majority of the members present; and its effect shall be to put an end to
all debate, and to bring the House to a direct vote upon a motion to commit
if such motion shall have been made; and if this motion does not prevail,
then upon amendments reported by a committee, if any; then upon pending
amendments, and then upon the main question. But its only effect, if
a motion to postpone is pending, shall be to bring the House to a vote
upon such motion. Whenever the House shall refuse to order the main
question, the consideration of the subject shall be resumed as though no
motion for the previous question had been made. The House may also, at
any time, on motion seconded by a majority of the members present, close
all debate upon a pending amendment, or an amendment thereto, and cause
the question to be put thereon; and this shall not preclude any further
amendment or debate upon the bill. A call of the House shall not be in
order after the previous question is seconded, unless it shall appear, upon
an actual count by the Speaker, that no quorum is present.</p>

<p>133. On a previous question there shall be no debate. All incidental
questions of order arising after a motion is made for the previous question
and pending such motion, shall be decided, whether on appeal or otherwise,
without debate.</p>

<h5>OF ADMISSION ON THE FLOOR.</h5>

<p>134. No person except members of the Senate, their secretary, heads of
departments, the President’s private secretary, foreign ministers, the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
for the time being of any State, Senators and Representatives elect,
and Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the Court
of Claims, shall be admitted within the hall of the House of Representatives,
or any of the rooms upon the same floor or leading into the same.</p>

<h5>OF REPORTERS.</h5>

<p>135. Stenographers and reporters, other than the official reporters of
the House, wishing to take down the debates, may be admitted by the
Speaker to the reporters’ gallery over the Speaker’s chair, but not on the
floor of the House; but no person shall be allowed the privilege of said
gallery under the character of stenographer or reporter without a written
permission of the Speaker, specifying the part of said gallery assigned to
him; nor shall said stenographer or reporter be admitted to said gallery
unless he shall state in writing for what paper or papers he is employed to
report; nor shall he be so admitted, or, if admitted, be suffered to retain
his seat, if he shall become an agent to prosecute any claim pending
before Congress; and the Speaker shall give his written permission with
this condition.</p>

<h5>UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.</h5>

<p>136. After six days from the commencement of a second or subsequent
session of any Congress, all bills, resolutions, and reports which originated
in the House, and at the close of the next preceding session remained
undetermined, shall be resumed and acted on in the same manner as if an
adjournment had not taken place. And all business before committees of
the House at the end of one session shall be resumed at the commencement
of the next session of the same Congress as if no adjournment had
taken place.</p>

<h5>MISCELLANEOUS.</h5>

<p>137. Whenever confidential communications are received from the
President of the United States, the House shall be cleared of all persons,
except the members, clerk, sergeant-at-arms, and doorkeeper, and so continue
during the reading of such communications, and (unless otherwise
directed by the House) during all debates and proceedings to be had
thereon. And when the Speaker, or any other member, shall inform the
House that he has communications to make which he conceives ought to
be kept secret, the House shall, in like manner, be cleared till the communication
be made; the House shall then determine whether the matter
communicated requires secrecy or not, and take order accordingly.</p>

<p>138. The rule for paying witnesses summoned to appear before this
House, or either of its committees, shall be as follows: for each day a witness
shall attend, the sum of two dollars; for each mile he shall travel in
coming to or going from the place of examination, the sum of ten cents
each way; but nothing shall be paid for traveling home when the witness
has been summoned at the place of trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span></p>

in or about the public grounds or buildings; and no person shall be an
officer of the House, or continue in its employment, who shall be an agent
for the prosecution of any claim against the government, or be interested
in such claim otherwise than an original claimant; and it shall be the
duty of the Committee of Accounts to inquire into and report to the House
any violation of this rule.</p>

<p>141. When the reading of a paper is called for, and the same is objected
to by any member, it shall be determined by a vote of the House.</p>

acted upon again during the session.</p>

<p>143. Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the
Senate shall be necessary, shall be read to the House, and laid on the
table, on a day preceding that in which the same shall be moved, unless
the House shall otherwise expressly allow.</p>

<p>144. The rules of parliamentary practice, comprised in Jefferson’s
Manual, shall govern the House in all cases to which they are applicable,
and in which they are not inconsistent with the standing rules and orders
of the House, and joint rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

<p>145. No standing rule or order of the House shall be rescinded or
changed without one day’s notice being given of the motion therefor; nor
shall any rule be suspended, except by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
members present; nor shall the order of business, as established by the
rules, be postponed or changed, except by a vote of at least two-thirds of
the members present; nor shall the Speaker entertain a motion to suspend
the rules, except during the last ten days of the session, and on Monday
of every week at the expiration of an hour after the journal is read, unless
the call of the States and Territories for bills on leave and resolutions has
been earlier concluded, when the Speaker may entertain a motion to suspend
the rules.</p>

<p>146. All election of officers of the House, including the Speaker, shall
be conducted in accordance with these rules, so far as the same are applicable;
and pending the election of a Speaker, the clerk shall preserve
order and decorum, and shall decide all questions of order that may arise,
subject to appeal to the House.</p>

<p>147. These rules shall be the rules of the House of Representatives of
the present and succeeding Congresses unless otherwise ordered.</p>

<p>148. An additional standing committee shall be appointed at the commencement
of each Congress, whose duties shall continue until the first
session of the ensuing Congress, to consist of five members, to be entitled a

and to this committee shall be referred all bills, resolutions, and communications
to the House upon that subject.</p>

<p>149. The names of members not voting on any call of the ayes and noes
shall be recorded in the journal immediately after those voting in the
affirmative and negative, and the same record shall be made in the Congressional
Globe.</p>

<p>150. It shall be the duty of the Committee on the Pacific Railroad to
take into consideration all such petitions and matters or things relative to
railroads or telegraph lines between the Mississippi valley and the Pacific

<p>155. The hall of the House shall not be used for any other purpose than
the legitimate business of the House, nor shall the Speaker entertain any
proposition to use it for any other purpose, or for the suspension of this
rule: Provided, That this shall not interfere with the performance of
divine service therein, under the direction of the Speaker, or with the use
of the same for caucus meetings of the members, or upon occasions where
the House may, by resolution, agree to take part in any ceremonies to be
observed therein.</p>

<p>156. There shall be appointed at the commencement of each Congress

<p>159. Estimates of appropriations, and all other communications from
the executive departments, intended for the consideration of any of the
committees of the House, shall be addressed to the Speaker and by him
submitted to the House for reference.</p>

<p>160. There shall be appointed to each Congress a Committee on Education
and Labor, to consist of nine members, to whom shall be referred all
petitions, bills, reports, and resolutions on those subjects, and who shall
from time to time report thereon.</p>

<p>161. Pending a motion to suspend the rules the Speaker may entertain

<h4>STATISTICS OF THE RACE.</h4>

<p>The earth is inhabited by about 1,380,000,000 of inhabitants, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>380,000,000 of the Caucasian race,</li>
<li>580,000,000 of the Mongolian,</li>
<li>200,000,000 of the Ethiopian,</li>
<li>220,000,000 of the Malay races, and</li>
<li>1,000,000 of the American Indian.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these respectively speak 3064 languages, and possess 1,000 different religions.</p>

<p>The amount of deaths per annum is 33,333,333, or 91,954 per day, 3730 per hour, 60 per
minute, or one per second. This loss is compensated by an equal number of births.</p>

<p>The average duration of life throughout the globe is thirty-three years. One-fourth of
its population dies before the seventh year, and one-half before the seventeenth. Out of
10,000 persons only one reaches his hundredth year; only one in 500 his eightieth; and
only one in 100 his sixty-fifth.</p>

<p>Married people live longer than unmarried ones, and a tall man is likely to live longer
than a short one. Until the fiftieth year women have a better chance of life than men;
but beyond that period the chances are equal.</p>

<p>Sixty-five persons out of one thousand marry. The months of June and December are
those in which marriages are most frequent.</p>

<p>Children born in spring are generally stronger than those born in other seasons.</p>

<p>Births and deaths chiefly occur at night.</p>

<p>The number of men able to bear arms is but one-eighth of the population.</p>

<h4>AFRICANS IN AMERICA.</h4>

<p>It is estimated that there are some 14,580,000 persons of African descent on this continent.
In the United States they number 4,880,000; Brazil 4,200,000; Cuba and Porto Rico
1,500,000; South and Central American Republics 1,100,000; Hayti 1,350,000; British Possessions
800,000; French, 250,000; Dutch and Mexican 400,000.</p>

<h4>CREEDS OF THE WORLD.</h4>

<p>The population of the world is religiously distributed very nearly in the following
proportions:</p>

<table summary="Religions of the world and the number of their adherents">
  <tr>
    <td>Christians</td>
    <td class="tdr">388,600,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buddhists</td>
    <td class="tdr">360,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Other Asiatic religions</td>
    <td class="tdr">260,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pagans</td>
    <td class="tdr">200,000,000</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jews</td>
    <td class="tdr">7,000,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In Europe, America, Australia, and many of the Polynesian Islands, <i>Christianity</i> is
the prevailing creed of every State. In Africa the only independent Christian States are
Abyssinia and Liberia, while Christianity prevails in several European colonies. The
largest empire of Asia—Russia—is also a Christian country. India, the third country in
point of extent, is under the rule of a Christian government, and so is a large portion of
Farther India.</p>

<p>The <i>Mohammedan</i> countries in Asia are Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, and the Khanates
of Central Asia; in Africa—Morocco, the dependencies of Turkey (Egypt, Tunis,
Tripoli) and a number of interior States.</p>

<p><i>Buddhism</i> prevails in India, Farther India, in many parts of China, and in Japan. The
governments of Burmah and Siam are Buddhist; the government of China adheres to the
religion of Confucius; the religion of Japan is <i>Sintooism</i>.</p>

<p><i>Judaism</i> is represented throughout the civilized world. The <i>Handbuch der Vergleichenden
Statistik</i> of G. Von Kolb (Leipzig, 1868) gives the following as the number of Jews
in the countries named: Germany, 478,500; Austria, 1,124,000; Great Britain, 40,000;
France, 80,000; European Russia, 2,277,000; Italy, 20,200; Switzerland, 4,200; Belgium
1,500; Netherlands, 64,000; Luxemburg, 1,500; Denmark, 4,200; Sweden, 1,000; Greece,
500; European Turkey, 70,000. The Jews in Portugal are estimated at 3,000; in Syria and
Asiatic Turkey, 52,000; in Morocco and North Africa, 610,000; in Eastern Asia, 500,800;
in America, 500,000.</p>
